# This is a configuration file for ar_sendmail daemon init.d script
#
# Define the settings for each app which has a mailer that you want start 
# automatically on startup.
#
# You can define an optional defaults section which will apply to all 
# applications unless the setting is specified under the applications specific 
# config.
#
# Settings not specified in either the defaults or app config section will
# be implied by the gem binary defaults. The option names are the same as the 
# long format binary option switches. Run 'ar_sendmail -h' to see option switches
# and default values.
#
# Copy this file to /etc/ar_sendmail.conf and it will be read by the init.d
# script.
