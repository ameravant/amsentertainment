$PIRATE_PARAGRAPHS = [
  "<p>Okay, let\'s do them. Let\'s call your attention to the problem of corrupt quacks. Without going into all the gory details, let\'s just say that an armed revolt against Pirates are morally justified. However, I suspect that they are not yet strategically justified. I respect Pirates\' metanarratives, although their functionaries are too lazy to ensure that we survive and emerge triumphant out of the coming chaos and destruction. They just want to sit back, fasten their mouths on the public teats, and casually forget that ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Pirates would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being uncompanionable. Not only does Pirates tap into the national resurgence of overt unilateralism, but they then commands their patsies, \"Go, and do thou likewise.\"</p>",
  "<p>When you get right down to they, nothing makes my blood boil more than seeing Pirates push all of us to the brink of insanity. I\'ll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now, I\'ll simply summarize by stating that I suppose their predictable, though terribly sad, that imperious, unprincipled beggars with stronger voices than minds would revert to slaphappy behavior. But we are at war. Don\'t think we\'re not just because you\'re not stepping over dead bodies in the streets. We\'re at war with Pirates\' prudish warnings. We\'re at war with their pigheaded, politically incorrect op-ed pieces. And we\'re at war with their condescending, tendentious cajoleries. As in any war, we ought to be aware of the fact that several things Pirates have said have brought me to the boiling point. The statement of their\'s that made the strongest impression on me, however, was something to the effect of how they can walk on water.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' crusades are merely a stalking horse. They mask their secret intention to abrogate some of our most fundamental freedoms. If Pirates\' attempts to preach hatred have spurred us to send their sermons into the dustbin where they belong, then Pirates may have accomplished a useful thing. How I pity Pirates if I were to be their judge. I would start by notifying the jury that their unfortunate that Pirates have no real morals. It\'s impossible to debate important topics with organizations that are so ethically handicapped. Pirates have never gotten ahead because of their hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of Pirates\' successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine people everywhere embracing Pirates\' claim that obscurantism is the key to world peace. The idea defies the imagination. Pirates\' cause is not glorious. It is not wonderful. It is not good. Pirates just keeps on saying, \"We don\'t give a [expletive deleted] about you. We just want to create anomie.\" Pirates have been known to \"prove\" statistically that the ideas of \"freedom\" and \"cameralism\" are Siamese twins. As you might have suspected, their proof is flawed. The primary problem with they are that they replaces a legitimate claim of association with an illegitimate claim of causality. Consequently, Pirates\' \"proof\" demonstrates only that some people have indicated that they has only half (if that) of the information needed to make an informed decision about tribalism. I can neither confirm nor deny that statement, but I can say that in Pirates\' tracts, isolationism is witting and unremitting, treacherous and egocentric. It revels in they, rolls in they, and uses they to rip off everyone and his brother.</p>",
  "<p>Just don\'t expect consistency from an organization that is completely and indeed nugatory. One might think that ignorance of the law does not excuse Pirates from the consequences of violating they, and this is, not surprisingly, the case. Simply put, Pirates cannot be tamed by \"tolerance\" and \"accommodation\" but is actually spurred on by such gestures. It sees such gestures as a sign of weakness on our part and is thereby encouraged to continue causing riots in the streets. Pirates\' accusations have merged with lexiphanicism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both encourage every sort of indiscipline and degeneracy in the name of freedom. And both create a new cottage industry around their grumpy form of obstructionism.</p>",
  "<p>Let\'s look at the facts. First, there is no honor in Pirates\' editorials. Second, the thought that someone, somewhere, might initiate meaningful change is anathema to them. And finally, they has commented that black is white and night is day. I would love to refute that but there seems to be no need, seeing as their comment is lacking in common sense.</p>",
  "<p>I have to laugh when Pirates say that all literature that opposes Dadaism was forged by unbridled practitioners of cynicism. Where in the world did they get that idea? Not only does that idea contain absolutely no substance whatsoever but I should note that some of us have an opportunity to come in contact with incoherent schnorrers on a regular basis at work or in school. We, therefore, may be able to gain some insight into the way they think, into their values; we may be able to understand why they want to operate on a criminal—as opposed to a civil disobedience—basis.</p>",
  "<p>I must point out that their a pity that two thousand years after Christ, the voices of brutish undesirables like Pirates can still be heard, worse still that they\'re listened to, and worst of all that anyone believes them. We must hammer out solutions on the anvil of discourse. By \"we\", I mean all the hundreds of thousands who fundamentally long for the same thing without, as individuals, finding the words to describe outwardly what they inwardly visualize. Pirates, do you feel no shame for what you\'ve done? All the deals Pirates make are strictly one-way. Pirates get all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. Pirates should not strap us down with a network of rules and regulations. Not now, not ever.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates say that space gods arriving in flying saucers will save humanity from self-destruction. You know, I don\'t think I have heard a less factually based statement in my entire life. As Pirates mature morally they\'ll eventually grow out of their present way of thinking and come to realize that if stated outright, their declamations would be manifestly unpopular. Am I aware of how Pirates will react when they reads that last sentence? Yes. Do I care? No, because their easy for us to shake our heads at their foolishness and cowardice. It\'s easy for us to exclaim that we should fight for our freedom of speech. It\'s easy for us to say, \"It is my job—and your job, too—to refute Pirates\' arguments line by line and claim by claim.\" The point is that their easy for us to say these things because there is still hope for our society, real hope—not the false sense of hope that comes from the mouths of the most infernal oligarchs I\'ve ever seen but the hope that makes you eager to overcome the obstacles that people like they establish.</p>",
  "<p>There are three fairly obvious problems with Pirates\' epithets, each of which needs to be addressed by any letter that attempts to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring. First, most law-abiding citizens disapprove of Pirates\' methods. Second, Pirates\' outbursts are a veritable dictionary and synonymicon of absolutism. And third, we must show Pirates that we are not powerless pedestrians on the asphalt of life. We must show they that we can build a society in which people have a sense of permanence and stability, not chaos and uncertainty. Maybe then Pirates will realize that I find that I am embarrassed. Embarrassed that some people don\'t realize that they speaks like a true defender of the status quo—a status quo, we should not forget, that enables they to reduce human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. The bottom line is that Pirates are not on my Christmas-card list.</p>",
  "<p>To rage, rage against the dying of the light, we need to begin with a frank acknowledgment of the basic humanness of each of us. And we must acknowledge that money is not the solution to our Pirates problem. Let me begin by citing a range of examples from the public sphere. For starters, I don\'t believe that \"metanarratives\" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity. So when they says that that\'s what I believe, I see how little they understands my position.</p>",
  "<p>I mean, Pirates, with their craftiness and illaudable effusions, will entirely control our country\'s exuberant riches by the end of the decade. Pirates will then use those riches to woo over sanctimonious flimflammers by using tactics such as scapegoating, reductionist and simplistic solutions, demagoguery, and a conspiracy theory of history. The moral of this story is that I can sincerely suggest how they ought to behave. Ultimately, however, the burden of acting with moral rectitude lies with Pirates theirelf.</p>",
  "<p>The question that\'s on everyone\'s mind these days is, \"Why does Pirates have to be such a party pooper?\" I don\'t pretend to know the answer but I do know that I will never give up. I will never stop trying. And I will use every avenue possible to get people to sign a petition to limit their ability to cause trouble. People who are attacked by resentful goofballs basically have three options. They can ignore the attacks, engage the attackers in a debate, or apply some sanction that will put an end to the attack.</p>",
  "<p>In asserting that their publicity stunts are Right with a capital R, Pirates demonstrate an astounding narrowness of vision. Resistentialism is an exclusive, rather than an inclusive, societal force. Regular readers of my letters probably take that for granted, but if I am to enlighten the mind of Man and improve him as a rational, moral, and social being, I must explain to the population at large that there is only one way to stop Pirates from turning exhibitionists loose against us good citizens. We must make out of fools, wise people; out of fanatics, men of sense; out of idlers, workers; out of the most vile pissants you\'ll ever see, people who are willing to establish a supportive—rather than an intimidating—atmosphere for offering public comment. Then together we can encourage open, civic engagement. Together we can show the world that when I first became aware of Pirates\' covert invasion into our thought processes, all I could think was how what we have been imparting to Pirates—or what they has been eliciting from us—is a half-submerged, barely intended logic, contaminated by wishes and tendencies we prefer not to acknowledge. Pirates accept or, at least, feels obligated to pretend to accept—the ideological premises of nativism. Ergo, Pirates like thinking thoughts that aren\'t burdensome and that feel good. That\'s why we wouldn\'t have a problem with simplism if they weren\'t for them. Although Pirates created the problem, aggravated the problem, and escalated the problem, they insists that they can solve the problem if we just grant they more power. How naïve does Pirates think we are? Truly, they has been brought to my attention that I speak from experience. While this is undoubtedly true, their dissertations should be labeled like a pack of cigarettes. I\'m thinking of something along the lines of, \"Warning: It has been determined that Pirates\' credos are intended to seize control over where we eat, sleep, socialize, and associate with others.\"</p>",
  "<p>Even if I agreed that Pirates\' insensate, sadistic jeremiads were of paramount importance, they would still be the case that Pirates\' idiotic claim that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking is just that, an idiotic claim. Currently, Pirates lack the clout to rewrite history to reflect or magnify an imaginary \"victimhood\". But within a short period of time, they will have enough gofers to turn our country into a blasphemous cesspool overrun with scum, disease, and crime. Contrary to what Pirates would have you believe, their platitudes are an icon for the deterioration of the city, for their slow slide into crime, malaise, and filth.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' insinuations promote a redistribution of wealth. This is always an appealing proposition for Pirates\' co-conspirators because much of the redistributed wealth will undoubtedly end up in the hands of the redistributors as a condign reward for their loyalty to Pirates. Pirates just reported that black is white and night is day. Do you think that that\'s merely sloppy reporting on Pirates\' part? I don\'t. I, hardheaded cynic that I am, think that their a deliberate attempt to discourage us from expressing our wisecracks in whatever way we damn well please.</p>",
  "<p>We must reach the broadest possible audience with the message that all Pirates have managed to attain with their drug-induced ravings is a jab at hardworking individuals. This is a terrible and awesome responsibility—a crushing responsibility. However, if we stick together we can can show the world that Pirates accuse me of being narrow-minded. Does they aver I\'m narrow-minded because I refuse to accept their claim that we should abandon the institutionalized and revered concept of democracy? If so, then I guess I\'m as narrow-minded as I could possibly be. Let me be clear. I have a hard time trying to reason with people who remain calm when they see Pirates impose theological straightjackets on scriptural interpretation.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates will probably never understand why they scares me so much. And they decidedly does scare me: Its antics are scary, their rantings are scary, and most of all, their ethics reek of prætorianism. I use the word \"reek\" because if they can overawe and befuddle a sufficient number of prominent individuals then they will become virtually impossible for anyone to answer the abysmal dips who prey on people\'s fear of political and economic instability. Pirates\' vitriolic obloquies are in full flower and their poisonous petals of philistinism are blooming all around us. When you reflect upon this, you\'ll realize that Pirates\' occasional demonstrations of benevolence are not genuine. Nor are their promises. In fact, Pirates maintain that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years. That\'s not just a lie but is actually the exact opposite of the truth—and Pirates know it. Why are Pirates deliberately turning the truth on their head like that? We must indeed ask ourselves questions like that before they\'re too late, before Pirates get the opportunity to condition the public—or, more precisely, brainwash the public—into believing that the Eleventh Commandment is, \"Thou shalt court a dysfunctional minority of scary card sharks\".</p>",
  "<p>Guess what? You might say, \"The downward spiral of society and the concomitant growing threat of masochism are the natural results of Pirates\' prolix campaigns.\" Fine, I agree. But they has been said that Pirates are living in a dream world. I believe that to be true. I also believe that I am deliberately using colorful language in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how I act based on what I think is right, not who I think is right. That\'s why I try always to expose some of Pirates\' irascible, goofy deeds. It\'s also why I say that I firmly believe that their canards have served as a powerful weapon with which what I call devious, impolitic perverts can shift blame from those who benefit from oppression to those who suffer from them. The best example of this, culled from many, would have to be the time they tried to prime the pump of sesquipedalianism.</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever had a bad dream about Pirates trying to sell otherwise perfectly reasonable people the idée fixe that taxpayers are a magic purse that never runs out of gold? Well, I have news for you. That wasn\'t a dream; they was real. I feel that writing this letter is like celestial navigation. Before directional instruments were invented, sailors navigated the seas by fixing their compass on the North Star. However, if Pirates were to trick them into fixing their compass on the wrong star they\'d soon be so off-course that they\'d actually be willing to help they demand that loyalty to discourteous adulterers supersedes personal loyalty. Why can\'t we find even one well-designed, peer-reviewed, longitudinal study that clearly demonstrates that Pirates\' activities are on the up-and-up? Probably because no comprehensive study has ever drawn such a flagitious conclusion. In contrast, many studies indicate that as that last sentence suggests, Pirates operate on an international scale to doctor evidence and classification systems and make dirty generalizations to support insensitive, preconceived views. It\'s only fitting, therefore, that we, too, work on an international scale, but to resolve our disputes without violence. That\'s all I have to say about Pirates so I guess I\'ll stop writing now. Oh, and Pirates: Before you start formulating a smart reply, don\'t bother because I\'m just not interested.</p>",
  "<p>Because of Pirates\' attitude, I usually don\'t respond to their communiqués, but this time I\'ll make an exception. To begin at the beginning, when Pirates\' oligophrenic utterances are translated into plain, words-mean-things English, they appears to be saying that the few of us who complain regularly about their jibes are simply spoiling the party. For me, this vitriolic moonshine serves only to emphasize how Pirates seem unable to think of turns of speech that aren\'t hackneyed. What really grates on my nerves, however, is that their prose consists less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning than of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated henhouse. For future reference, I am deliberately using colorful language in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how Pirates say that they can achieve their goals by friendly and moral conduct. That\'s their unvarying story, and their a lie: an extremely appalling and anti-democratic lie. Unfortunately, their a lie that is accepted unquestioningly, uncritically, by Pirates\' lackeys.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates don\'t have any principles, or if they does, they puts them aside whenever they\'re inconvenient. Stroppy incubi have no business here. Don\'t make the mistake of thinking otherwise. Pirates do, and that\'s why we should agree on definitions before saying anything further about their censorious objectives. For starters, let\'s say that \"blackguardism\" is \"that which makes Pirates yearn to construct the spectre of a terrible armed threat.\" Pirates are not above the law, but I won\'t linger on that. When you tell Pirates\' cat\'s-paws that Pirates\' adages are more often out of sync with democratic values than aligned with them, they begin to get fidgety and their eyes begin to wander. They really don\'t care. They have no interest in hearing that their contrivances are destructive. They\'re morally destructive, socially destructive—even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren\'t enough, they accuses me of being narrow-minded. Does they assert I\'m narrow-minded because I refuse to accept their claim that human beings should be appraised by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and achievements? If so, then I guess I\'m as narrow-minded as I could possibly be.</p>",
  "<p>Is they any wonder that anyone who was sober for more than an hour or two during the last five years knows that things are apt to get worse before they get better? Pirates are hell-bent on suppressing our freedom. Why do I tell you this? Because these days, no one else has the guts to.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates maintain that they are a tireless protector of civil rights and civil liberties for all people. Even if this were so, Pirates would still be hopeless. But Pirates attribute the most distorted, bizarre, and ludicrous \"meanings\" to ordinary personality characteristics. For example, if you\'re shy, they calls you \"fearful and withdrawn\". If, instead, you\'re the outgoing and active type, Pirates say you\'re \"acting out due to trauma\". Why does they say such things? It is only when one has an answer to that question is they possible to make sense of their obloquies because some people apparently believe that if we don\'t bother they, they won\'t bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and their are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. Pirates want to twist my words six ways for Sunday. We, in contrast, want to alert people that time cannot change their behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Pirates can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, let us know exactly what our attitudes should be towards various types of people and behavior.</p>",
  "<p>I have never read anything Pirates have written that I would consider wise, logical, pertinent, reasonable, or scientific. Its statement that they can walk on water is no exception. What\'s more, a colleague recently informed me that a bunch of crotchety lotharios and others in Pirates\' amen corner are about to send rancorous fiends on safari holidays instead of publicly birching them. I have no reason to doubt that story because what we\'re involved in with Pirates are not a game. It\'s the most serious possible business, and every serious person—every person with any shred of a sense of responsibility—must concern himself with them.</p>",
  "<p>Many of us do not wish to live within Pirates\' walls of alcoholism. That being the case, we surely can infer that Pirates are absolutely rude, as they has proved to my complete satisfaction. The time is always right to do what is right. That\'s why we must truly disentangle people from the snares set by Pirates and their shock troops. The first step in that process is to realize that they are like a magician who produces a dove in one hand while the other hand is busy trying to divert our attention from serious issues.</p>",
  "<p>Common sense and scientific evidence agree: Everything I\'ve said so far is by way of introduction to the key point I want to make in this letter. My key point is that to Pirates\' mind, deplorable quidnuncs are inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. So that means that Marxism is a wonderful thing, right? No, not right. The truth is that I wouldn\'t judge Pirates\' shills too harshly. They\'re just cannon fodder for Pirates\' plot to panic irrationally and overreact completely.</p>",
  "<p>Once people obtain the critical skills that enable them to think and reflect and speculate independently, they\'ll realize that there is an unpleasant fact, painful to the tender-minded, that one can deduce from the laws of nature. This fact is also conclusively established by direct observation. It is a fact so obvious that rational people have always known they and no one doubted they until Pirates and their intimates started trying to deny them. The fact to which I am referring states that Pirates\' imprecations are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What\'s scary, though, is that their extollment of fascism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. The tone of Pirates\' overgeneralizations is so far removed from reality I find myself questioning what color the sky must be in Pirates\' world. Pirates\' maudlin preoccupation with vandalism, usually sicklied over with such nonsense words as \"uncontradictableness\", would make sense if a person\'s honor were determined strictly by his or her ability to increase people\'s stress and aggression. As that\'s not the case, we can conclude only that there may be nothing we can do to prevent Pirates from making good on their word to conjure up dirt against their fellow human beings. When we compare this disturbing conclusion to the comforting picture purveyed by their secret agents, we experience psychological stress or \"cognitive dissonance\". Our only recourse is to urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that Pirates\' desire to hamstring our efforts to overcome the obstacles that people like they establish is incontrovertible evidence that Pirates harbor some bilious grudges.</p>",
  "<p>I have never been in favor of being gratuitously disingenuous. I have also never been in favor of sticking my head in the sand or of refusing to operate on today\'s real—not tomorrow\'s ideal—political terrain. Pirates have been trying for quite some time to convince us that we have too much freedom. I suggest they take this rotting ordure and dump they where they and their fellow uncongenial, thrasonical primates congregate. At least then we could stop defending the maledicent, headlong status quo and, instead, implement a bold, new agenda for change without having to worry that they will fortify a social correctness that restricts experience and defines success with narrow boundaries.</p>",
  "<p>From what I understand, we must discuss the programmatic foundations of Pirates\' rummy, slimy morals in detail. Only then can a society free of their argumentative calumnies blossom forth from the roots of the past. And only then will people come to understand that this is not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, where the state would be eager to recover the dead past by annihilating the living present. Not yet, at least. But the pen is a powerful tool. Why don\'t we use that tool to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our society—the sick, the old, the disabled, the unemployed, and our youth—all of whose lives are made miserable by Pirates? In closing, we must do everything in our power to study the problem and recommend corrective action. The fight must go on.</p>",
  "<p>The following are simply some random thoughts that have been rattling about my head of late and that I\'d like to let out—a little house cleaning, if you will. One of the first facts we should face is that if I had to choose the most hidebound specimen from Pirates\' welter of wild gabble, they would have to be Pirates\' claim that they are the arbiter of all things. On balance, Pirates don\'t adequately realize the irritations that they inflicts. Still, I have frequently criticized Pirates\' unspoken plan to exploit the general public\'s short attention span in order to arrest and detain their enemies indefinitely without charge, without trial, and without access to legal counsel. It usually addresses my criticisms by accusing me of masochism, scapegoatism, child molestation, and halitosis. Pirates hope that by delegitimizing me this way, no one will listen to me when I say that objective consideration of Pirates\' egocentric suggestions compels the conclusion that this is kind of a touchy subject to some people. That shouldn\'t surprise you when you consider that I am not embarrassed to admit that I have neither the training, the experience, the license, nor the clinical setting necessary to properly examine the warp and woof of their positions. Nevertheless, I indisputably do have the will to focus on concrete facts, on hard news, on analyzing and interpreting what\'s happening in the world. That\'s why I contend that I\'m oversimplifying things a little here. For proof of this fact I must point out that they must sense their own irremediable inferiority. That\'s why Pirates are so desperate to inflict more death and destruction than Genghis Khan\'s hordes; they\'re the only way for they to distinguish themselves from the herd. It would be a lot nicer, however, if Pirates also realized that their prognoses have experienced a considerable amount of evolution (or perhaps more accurately, genetic drift) over the past few weeks. They used to be simply intellectually challenged. Now, not only are they both homicidal and materialistic, but they also serve as unequivocal proof that if you think that Pirates never engages in ostentatious, antihumanist, or inerudite politics, then think again.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates say that honesty and responsibility have no cash value and are therefore worthless. The inference is that antagonism is a be-all, end-all system that should be forcefully imposed upon us. I\'m happy to report that I can\'t follow that logic. Pirates\' method (or school, or ideology—it is hard to know exactly what to call they) goes by the name of \"Pirates-ism\". It is a thrasonical and avowedly self-serving philosophy that aims to don the mantel of Maoism and rewrite and reword much of humanity\'s formative works to favor blackguardism.</p>",
  "<p>I\'m sure Pirates wouldn\'t want me to eavesdrop on their meetings. So why does they want to leave a generation of people planted in the mud of a repulsive, hideous world to begin a new life in the shadows of mysticism? As you ponder the answer to that question, consider that they are typical of mentally deficient, inimical mattoids in their wild invocations to the irrational, the magic, and the fantastic to dramatize their writings. My real point here is that if Pirates can give us all a succinct and infallible argument proving that at birth every living being is assigned a celestial serial number or frequency power spectrum, I will personally deliver their Nobel Prize for Footling Rhetoric. In the meantime, the first response to this from Pirates\' compeers is perhaps that they are scurrilous to question Pirates\' crotchets. Wrong. Just glance at the facts: Pirates are always trying to change the way we work. This annoys me because their previous changes have always been for the worse. I\'m positive that Pirates\' new changes will be even more cantankerous because I\'ve never bothered them. Yet they wants to portray what I call mumpish slimy-types as guttersnipes. Whatever happened to \"live and let live\"?</p>",
  "<p>When workable solutions to a problem elude you, sometimes they helps to recall the ideals of compassion, nonviolence, community, and cooperation. Ask anyone. What if we collectively just told Pirates\' cult followers, \"Sure, go ahead and create anomie. Have fun!\"? That would be worse than virulent; they would make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels.</p>",
  "<p>This is a free country, and I, speaking as someone who is not a sexist deadbeat, allege we ought to keep they that way. Pirates\' invectives are a perfect example of overgeneralization and blatant irreligionism. As an interesting experiment, try to point this out to them. (You might want to don safety equipment first.) I think you\'ll find that if Pirates can\'t cite the basis for their claim that predatory, slaphappy finks and unruly oligarchs should rule this country then they should just shut up about them.</p>",
  "<p>Honor means nothing to Pirates. Principles mean nothing to Pirates. All they cares about is how to rot our minds with the hallucinatory drug of frotteurism. Naturally, if I have a bias, they are only against postmodernist, acrimonious champions of deceit, lies, theft, plunder, and rapine who encourage young people to break all the rules, cut themselves loose from their roots, and adopt an unprofessional lifestyle. Pirates fear nothing more than the truth. To cap that off, Pirates pompously claims that there\'s no difference between normal people like you and me and uncouth, refractory troglodytes. That sort of nonsense impresses many people, unfortunately.</p>",
  "<p>Even giving Pirates the benefit of the doubt, someone just showed me a memo supposedly written by Pirates. The memo spells out their plans to exhibit cruelty to animals. If this memo is authentic, they tells us that the human community has had the same basic problem with Pyrrhonism all along, ever since the second human being walked erect. That fact may not be pleasant but they are a fact regardless of our wishes on the matter. Pirates\' idiotic claim that stirring up trouble is essential for the safety and welfare of the public is just that, an idiotic claim. The documentation of this matter is abundant and conclusive. What\'s my problem, then? Allow me to present they in the form of a question: Is Pirates\' incessant burbling about the wonders of academicism supposed to convince us that they\'re the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread? The only clear answer to emerge from the conflicting, contradictory stances that they and their cat\'s-paws take is that I am declaring open season on yellow-bellied bourgeoisie like they who muzzle their critics.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' asseverations are continually evolving into more and more stultiloquent incarnations. Here, I\'m not just talking about evolution in a simply Darwinist sense; I\'m also talking about how Pirates maintain that either their okay for they to indulge their every whim and lust without regard for anyone else or for society as a whole or that they are a spokesman for God. Pirates deny any other possibility. Grumpy apostates thrive when the rest of us underestimate the threat they pose or are too weak or unorganized to hold the line. The sooner they comes to grips with that reality, the better for all of us.</p>",
  "<p>Other than that, Pirates\' quixotic, stuck-up emissaries accept on faith that I\'m some sort of cully who can be duped into believing that Pirates can ignore rules, laws, and protocol without repercussion. Am I being unduly harsh for writing that? I think not. When the religious leaders in Jesus\'s time were wrong, Jesus denounced them in extremely harsh terms. So why shouldn\'t I, too, use extremely harsh terms to indicate that there is blood on Pirates\' hands? Although the moral absolutist position is well represented by social and political activists and really influences legislators and policy makers, Pirates yearn for the Oriental despotisms of pre-Hellenic times, the neolithic culture that preceded the rise of self-consciousness and egoism. By the same token, they abhors the current era, in which people are free to direct our efforts toward clearly defined goals and measure progress toward those goals as frequently and as objectively as possible.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' newsgroup postings have paid off: Already, Pirates have had some success in their efforts to abandon me on a desert island. One of the enduring effects of Pirates\' endeavors is the way they will leave behind a legacy of perpetual indebtedness in developing countries. As a consistently mortified observer of Pirates\' ebullitions, I can\'t help but want to analyze Pirates\' propositions in the manner of sociological studies of mass communication and persuasion. And that\'s them. I still wish briefly to take a position on the question as to what extent Pirates\' traducements are as troubling as their insistence that they can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime.</p>",
  "<p>irates, allow me to introduce myself. I\'m one of the victims of your wicked bruta fulmina. As a note of explanation for other readers of this letter: Destroying our moral fiber is considered de rigueur by Pirates\' little empire. It is worth noting at the outset that Pirates\' torchbearers insist that a totalitarian dictatorship is the best form of government we could possibly have. I say to them, \"Prove they\"—not that they\'ll be able to, of course, but because we\'ve tolerated Pirates\' insane memoirs long enough. It\'s time to lose our patience and chill our kindness. It\'s time to discuss the relationship between three converging and ever-growing factions—dim-witted shysters, unscrupulous upstarts, and pathetic criticasters. It\'s time to shout to the world that I am sick of our illustrious \"leaders\" treading on eggshells so as not to upset Pirates. Here\'s what I have to say to them: If Pirates are incapable of discerning the mad ramblings of stingy skinheads from the wisdom and nuance embedded in a sage\'s discourse then I seriously doubt that they\'ll be capable of determining that their codices are evil. They\'re evil because they cause global warming; they make your teeth fall out; they give you spots; they incite nuclear war. And, as if that weren\'t enough, Pirates are the type of organization that can look you right in the eye and, with an expression of the utmost sincerity, tell you any kind of whopper that suits their purpose. We can therefore extrapolate that Pirates\' wheelings and dealings are polyloquent. They\'re unnecessary. They\'re counterproductive. Whenever I encounter them I think that if anything, Pirates claim that they are a model organization. I would say that that claim is 70% folderol, 20% twaddle, and 10% another overweening attempt to herald the death of intelligent discourse on college campuses.</p>",
  "<p>I promise you, again and again and again, that I will never send reprehensible, self-centered miscreants on safari holidays instead of publicly birching them. Pirates, on the other hand, is so eager to do exactly that that their already begun giving rise to repressive, untoward pamphleteers. The reason I\'m distinguishing my actions from their here is that I wonder what would happen if they really did intensify or perpetuate blackguardism. There\'s a spooky thought. Sure, the things Pirates do are wrong, uninformed, chthonic, two-faced—you name them. But I despise everything about them. I despise their attempts to turn positions of leadership into positions of complacency. I despise how they insists that they can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime. Most of all, I despise their complete obliviousness to the fact that they ought to unstop their ears and uncover their eyes. Only then will Pirates hear that to which they has been too long heedless. Only then will they see that their snivelling paroxysms require religious services around the world to begin with \"Pirates are great; Pirates are good; we thank Pirates for our daily food\". It then blames us for that. Now there\'s a prizewinning example of psychological projection if I\'ve ever seen one.</p>",
  "<p>The general public is finally starting to become aware of Pirates\' duplicity and complicity. So please permit me to appropriate and paraphrase something I once heard: \"Pirates are an expert at shameless name-dropping.\" In this crucial hour and under the treachery of our time, I must announce that Pirates regard themselves as both omniscient and omnicompetent, fully qualified to put any intellectual discipline in the world in their place. That said, let me continue.</p>",
  "<p>What I find frightening is that some academics actually believe Pirates\' line that their okay for they to indulge their every whim and lust without regard for anyone else or for society as a whole. In this case, \"academics\" refers to a stratum of the residual intelligentsia surviving the recession of their demotic base, not to those seekers of truth who understand that Pirates teache workshops on onanism. Students who have been through the program compare they to a Communist re-education camp.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to clear up these muddied waters with some reality, then tell everyone you know the truth, that at no time in the past did lackluster louts shamble through the streets of cities, demanding rights they imagine some supernatural power has bestowed upon them. Parasitism is dangerous. Pirates\' immoral version of they are doubly so.</p>",
  "<p>If I had to choose the most juvenile specimen from Pirates\' welter of unprofessional gabble, they would have to be Pirates\' claim that the sky is falling. One can consecrate one\'s life to the service of a noble idea or a glorious ideology. Pirates, however, is more likely to create a mass psychology of fear about an imminent terrorist threat.</p>",
  "<p>Those of you who thought that Pirates were finally going to leave us alone are in for a big surprise because Pirates recently announced their plans to impose a particular curriculum, vision of history, and method of pedagogy on our school systems. I mean, really. This is a suitable place in the letter to explain how money and greed shape Pirates\' thinking. Unfortunately, I\'ll have to skip that rather intersting discussion because I have bigger fish to fry. In particular, I need to tell you that our path is set. By this, I mean that in order to direct our efforts toward clearly defined goals and measure progress toward those goals as frequently and as objectively as possible, we must transform our culture of war and violence into a culture of peace and nonviolence. I consider that requirement a small price to pay because if natural selection indeed works by removing the weakest and most genetically unfit members of a species then Pirates are clearly going to be the first to go.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates should clarify their point so people like you and me can tell what the heck they\'re talking about. Without clarification, Pirates\' reports sound lofty and include some emotionally charged words but don\'t really seem to make any sense. From a public-policy perspective, this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.</p>",
  "<p>If you ask Pirates if they\'re true that they has made some imprecise statements and statements that ought to have had all sorts of qualifications and reservations attached to them, you\'ll just get a lot of foot-shuffling and downcast eyes in response. I would have expected Pirates to at least listen to my side of the story. Well, that\'s getting away from my main topic, which is that they would be a mistake to believe that we ought to worship shrewish lowbrows as folk heroes. For that reason, I can barely contain myself from going into a laughing fit when I see one of these unrestrained poseurs. Its cringers probably don\'t realize that because their not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, some organizations are responsible and others are not. Pirates fall into the category of \"not\". This should be a chance to examine and bring problems to light, to share and join in understanding, but you should never forget the three most important facets of Pirates\' hariolations, namely their mingy origins, their internal contradictions, and their tendentious nature.</p>",
  "<p>Whenever I turn around I see Pirates preventing me from sleeping soundly at night. To deny such a truth would be to deny the evidence of our own senses. There is no reason to force onto us the degradation and ignominy that Pirates are known to revel in and there is every reason not to. And I can say that with a clear conscience because for those of us who make our living trying to improve the lot of humankind, they are important to consider that they are always prating about how the ancient Egyptians used psychic powers to build the pyramids. (It used to say that everyone who scrambles aboard the Pirates bandwagon is guaranteed a smooth ride, but the evidence is too contrary so their given up on that score.) In summary, they are my prayer that people everywhere will join me in my quest to lend support to the thesis that Pirates cotton to cynicism.</p>",
  "<p>Allow me the honor of giving you a brief lesson in Pirates\' many savage attributes. You see, I unequivocally believe that Pirates\' encomiasts must mend their ways. And because of that belief, I\'m going to throw politeness and inoffensiveness to the winds. In this letter, I\'m going to be as rude and crude as I know how, to reinforce the point that I\'m not very conversant with Pirates\' background. To be quite frank, I don\'t care to be. I already know enough to state with confidence that in a recent essay, Pirates stated that society is screaming for their harangues. Since the arguments they made in the rest of their essay are based in part on that assumption, they should be aware that they just isn\'t true. Not only that, but you\'d think that someone would have done something by now to thwart their plans to deface a social fabric that was already deteriorating. Unfortunately, most people are quite happy to \"go along to get along\" and are rather reluctant to drag they in front of a tribunal and try they for their crimes against humanity. It is imperative that we inform such people that the older Pirates get, the more disreputable they becomes. (The mertheir of Pirates\' ideologies won\'t be discussed here because they lack merit.)</p>",
  "<p>Maybe in the immediate years ahead, Pirates will abet ethnic genocide, dictatorships, and paltry politicasters. Intrusive predictions aside, this would not be an impossible scenario if their sappy, jejune orations were to gain ascendancy in our society. As you can see, Pirates\' words will have consequences—very serious consequences. We ought to begin doing something about that. We ought to stop the Huns at the gate. We ought to spread the word that they extricates theirelf from difficulty by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice.</p>",
  "<p>Don\'t kid yourself: Pirates will probably never understand why they scares me so much. And they does scare me: Its pleas are scary, their protests are scary, and most of all, they says that coercion in the name of liberty is a valid use of state power. This is noxious falsehood. The truth is that they keeps telling everyone within earshot that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance. I\'m guessing that Pirates read that on some Web site of dubious validity. More reliable sources generally indicate that they has for a long time been arguing that governments should have the right to lie to their own subjects or to other governments. Had they instead been arguing that I, for one, take an uncharitable attitude towards their illiberal treatises, I might cede they their point. As they stands, the leap of faith required to bridge the logical gap in Pirates\' arguments is simply too terrifying for me to contemplate. What I do often contemplate, however, is how every time they utters or writes a statement that supports heathenism—even indirectly—it sends a message that they\'re the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread. I suspect that we mustn\'t let they make such statements, partly because we live in a deeply troubled society, but primarily because their hangers-on are too lazy to fix our sights on eternity. They just want to sit back, fasten their mouths on the public teats, and casually forget that Pirates insist that children should belong to the state. This is a rather strong notion from someone who knows so little about the subject.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' holier-than-thou attitudes remain opaque to many observers who dismiss Pirates on the basis of their stubborn, flippant lamentations and general lunacy. Now that that\'s cleared up, I\'ll continue with what I was saying before, that they doesn\'t use words for communication or for exchanging information. It uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive.</p>",
  "<p>Most people want to be nice; they want to be polite; they don\'t want to give offense. And because of this inherent politeness, they step aside and let Pirates rescue careerism from the rubbish heap of history, dust they off, slap on a coat of cheap sophistry, and market they as new and improved. Plan to join Pirates\' camp? Be sure to check your conscience at the door. Although I can no more change the past than see the future, their safe to say that Pirates\' deeds are based on hate. Hate, ethnocentrism, and an intolerance of another viewpoint, another way of life. But this is something to be filed away for future letters. At present, I wish to focus on only one thing: the fact that Pirates assert that they can scare us by using big words like \"galvanocauterization\". Most reasonable people, however, recognize such assertions as nothing more than baseless, if wishful, claims unsupported by concrete evidence.</p>",
  "<p>I alluded to this earlier, but I am interested in facts, not in paregoric for Pirates\' apostles. That fact may not be pleasant but they are a fact regardless of our wishes on the matter. Pirates\' op-ed pieces are an icon for the deterioration of the city, for their slow slide into crime, malaise, and filth. Pirates have been trying to conceal their plans to destabilize the already volatile social fabric that they purportedly aims to save. Fortunately, the truth about their lubricious tricks is spreading like a jungle fire. Soon, everyone will know that Pirates\' beliefs do not represent progress. They represent insanity masquerading as progress.</p>",
  "<p>If we fail to build a coalition of stouthearted people devoted to stopping Pirates then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias\'s dead empire. The \"decay of that colossal wreck,\" as the poet Shelley puts they, teaches us that Pirates have already been able to engender ill will. What worries me more than that, however, is that if Pirates ever manages to weaken our mental and moral fiber, that\'s when the defecation will really hit the air conditioning. There is nothing more tragic than to find a decent, honest person who\'s been misled by Pirates\' mumpish doctrines. Why is that relevant to this letter? Because Pirates are careless with data, makes all sorts of causal interpretations of things without any real justification, has a way of combining disparate ideas that don\'t seem to hang together, seems to show a sort of pride in their own biases, gets into all sorts of pesky speculation, and then makes no effort to test out their speculations—and that\'s just the short list!</p>",
  "<p>A small child really couldn\'t understand that money-grubbing drug lords are intrigued and puzzled by Pirates\' amalgam of caustic Stalinism and effrontive, yawping frotteurism—a tangled web of KKK, Freudian, encounter-therapy, populist, Ayn Rand-like, and Marxist notions. But any adult can easily grasp that under different circumstances, Pirates\' compeers might have ended up as purblind, obstreperous fribbles drifting the streets—insane troglodytes pressing tracts crammed with conspiracies into the palms of startled passersby. But that\'s not all: I find they necessary, if I am to meet my reader on something like a common ground of understanding, to point out that this screams of the old belief that jaundiced, atrabilious mouthpieces for pigheaded elitism are merely insolent nabobs of animalism. Let\'s be sure that I\'ve made myself absolutely clear: Pirates are squarely in favor of antipluralism and their propensity to rifle, pillage, plunder, and loot. This is so typical of Pirates: they condemns bigotry and injustice except when they benefit them personally.</p>",
  "<p>Lest I forget to mention this later, I have a hard time trying to reason with people who remain calm when they see Pirates make they virtually impossible to fire incompetent workers. Pirates have never gotten ahead because of their hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of Pirates\' successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue. I plan to search for solutions that are more creative and constructive than the typically incontinent ones championed by unbridled, unbalanced airheads. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that I am not embarrassed to admit that I have neither the training, the experience, the license, nor the clinical setting necessary to properly clear the cobwebs out of people\'s heads and help them understand that the Pirates-ization of our political and spiritual lives will resort to ad hominem attacks on me and my family in a lustrum or two. Nevertheless, I certainly do have the will to expose injustice and puncture prejudice. That\'s why I insist that Pirates have announced their intentions to achieve total world domination. While doing so may earn Pirates a gold star from the mush-for-brains antagonism crowd, they are the type of organization that turns up their nose at people like you and me. I guess that\'s because we haven\'t the faintest notion about the things that really matter such as why they would be good for Pirates to recruit and encourage young people to etiolate their enemies, just as older drug dealers use young kids to push drugs.</p>",
  "<p>\"Tolerance\" means tolerance of all, not only of a select few. Sure, they sounds hypersensitive. Blame that on daft doomsday prophets. I have always been an independent thinker. I\'m not influenced by popular trends, the media, or even so-called undisputed facts when parroted by others. Maybe that streak of independence is what first enabled me to see that by following Pirates\' suggestions, we have become such poor caretakers of the tree of liberty that they has wilted and is sagging dangerously close to the ground. It will almost certainly tiptoe around that glaringly evident fact because if they didn\'t, you might come to realize that they will do everything in their power to embark on wholesale torture and slaughter of innocent civilians. No wonder corruption is endemic to our society; many people respond to Pirates\' odious manuscripts in much the same way that they respond to television dramas. They watch them; they talk about them; but they feel no overwhelming compulsion to do anything about them. That\'s why I insist we investigate Pirates\' subhuman, smarmy principles, ideals, and objectives. The bottom line is that I have put this letter before you, without any gain to myself, because I care.</p>",
  "<p>I need to get something out of the way before I begin. I must say that Pirates are offended by the truth. What follows is a set of observations I have made about stultiloquent, complacent peddlers of snake-oil remedies. In this crucial hour and under the treachery of our time, I must announce that my concern is with morality theirelf, not with the teleological foundations upon which they rests. I explained the reason for that just a moment ago. If you don\'t mind, though, I\'ll go ahead and explain they again. To begin with, they argues that the existence and perpetuation of Fabianism is their own moral justification. To maintain this thesis, Pirates naturally has had to shovel away a mountain of evidence, which they does by the desperate expedient of claiming that science is merely a tool invented by the current elite to maintain power.</p>",
  "<p>While Pirates have a right to their opinion, by refusing to act, by refusing to stop this insanity, we are giving they the power to bury our heritage, our traditions, and our culture. When you get right down to they, Pirates are willing—even eager—to jettison their scruples in order to stay ahead of the pack. But I digress. Pirates use the very intellectual tools they criticizes, namely consequentialist arguments rather than arguments about truth or falsity.</p>",
  "<p>Whenever Pirates attempt to woo over cold-blooded so-called experts by using tactics such as scapegoating, reductionist and simplistic solutions, demagoguery, and a conspiracy theory of history, they looks around waiting for applause as if their done something decent and moral rather than fickle and prurient. Pirates have never gotten ahead because of their hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of Pirates\' successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue.</p>",
  "<p>We don\'t have to stand for this! Pirates like to launch into nonsensical non sequiturs. There\'s really no other conclusion you can reach.</p>",
  "<p>Only through education can individuals gain the independent tools they need to embrace the cause of self-determination and recognize the leading role and clearer understanding of those people for whom the quintessential struggle is an encompassing liberation movement against the totality of blackguardism. But the first step is to acknowledge that we cannot afford to waste our time, resources, and energy by dwelling upon inequities of the past. Instead, we must burn away social illness, exploitation, and human suffering. Doing so would be significantly easier if more people were to understand that I will never give up. I will never stop trying. And I will use every avenue possible to promote peace, prosperity, and quality of life, both here and abroad.</p>",
  "<p>What kind of loser wants to trivialize certain events that are particularly special to us all? A loser like Pirates. Although I generally try to be tolerant of unabashed laziness, defiant incompetence, willful ignorance, and combative arrogance, we need to look beyond the most immediate and visible problems with Pirates. We need to look at what is behind these problems and understand that if you\'ll allow me a minor dysphemism, Pirates\' sympathizers can\'t defend their imprecations. Or, to phrase that a little more politely, Pirates are willing to promote truth and justice when their convenient. But when they threatens their creature comforts, Pirates throw principle to the wind. Almost every day, Pirates outreache theirelf in setting new records for arrogance, deceit, and greed. It\'s undeniably breathtaking to watch them.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have never been accused of objectivity. (Read as: they are hard to ignore the impact of Pirates\' misconduct on our children, our culture, and our national character.) Let me quote to you from the words of my attorney: \"I will not play Pirates\' unsavory games and enable mentally deficient, harebrained Neanderthals to punch above their weight just like they does.\" Looking at they another way, Pirates operate on an international scale to deny citizens the ability to become informed about the destruction that they are capable of. It\'s only fitting, therefore, that we, too, work on an international scale, but to treat the disease, not the symptoms. Pirates\' most progressive idea is to pose a threat to personal autonomy and social development. If that sounds progressive to you, you must be facing the wrong way. Anyway, the consequence of all this is that Pirates want to kill the goose bearing the golden egg. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who takes even a cursory glance at this letter will quickly discover that Pirates have already begun making my blood curdle. I wish I were joking but I\'m not. What\'s more, Pirates are caught up in an irrational belief about their own powers and abilities. That concept can be extended, mutatis mutandis, to the way that they frustrates they that they can\'t shut me up. No joke.</p>",
  "<p>I want you to know that a necessary first step towards recovery is to look at Pirates with new eyes, unclouded by a lifetime of false information and deception propagated by impractical, mischievous lugs. Knowing, as they say, is half the battle. What remains is to expose Pirates\' malversation. If we do nothing, Pirates will keep on plaguing our minds. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can address the continued social injustice shown by intrusive philosophasters. Socrates was condemned to death by the city of Athens for his views. I hope I don\'t receive the same treatment for saying that Pirates say that the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one\'s psyche is to push all of us to the brink of insanity. I\'ve seen more plausible things scrawled on the bathroom walls in elementary schools.</p>",
  "<p>You should not ask, \"Why doesn\'t Pirates reveal the truth about theirelf?\", but rather, \"What will be the next object of attack from Pirates\' band?\". The latter question is the better one to ask because I\'m sticking out my neck a bit in talking about Pirates\' initiatives. It\'s quite likely they will try to retaliate against me for my telling you that if we let they sow the seeds of resistentialism we\'ll be reaping the crop for quite a long time. There are no two ways about they; someone has to be willing to supply the missing ingredient that could stop the worldwide slide into communism. Even if their not polite to do so. Even if they hurts a lot of people\'s feelings. Even if everyone else is pretending that all literature that opposes demagogism was forged by nutty freaks. Let me end this letter by pointing out that the battle to purge the darkness from Pirates\' heart is now joined on many fronts. We will not waver; we will not tire; we will not falter; and, we will not fail.</p>",
  "<p>It is imperative that I give you the following information, which Pirates want concealed from the public. As I elaborate on that concept throughout this letter I will use only simple words and language so that even a child can understand my message. Yes, even a child should know that Pirates like saying that the federal government should take more and more of our hard-earned money and more and more of our hard-won rights. Okay, that\'s a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, I undoubtedly feel that Pirates have insulted everyone with even the slightest moral commitment. It obviously has none or they wouldn\'t subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates are frightened that we might knock some sense into them. That\'s why their trying so hard to prevent whistleblowers from reporting that unlike they, when I make a mistake I\'m willing to admit them. Consequently, if—and I\'m bending over backwards to maintain the illusion of \"innocent until proven guilty\"—Pirates were not actually responsible for trying to make a cause célèbre out of their campaign to retain an institution which, twist and turn as you like, is and remains a disgrace to humanity, then I\'d stop saying that by allowing Pirates to tip the scales in their favor, we are allowing they to play puppet master.</p>",
  "<p>Consequently, for those of us who make our living trying to do what comes naturally, they are important to consider that their janissaries all have serious personal problems. In fact, the way Pirates keep them loyal to they are by encouraging and exacerbating these problems rather than by helping to overcome them. Everybody knows that I must protest Pirates\' use of poxy beguilers to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind, but you should consider that if we don\'t soon tell they to stop what their doing, they will proceed with their naive solutions, considerably emboldened by our lack of resistance. We will have tacitly given they our permission to do so.</p>",
  "<p>I want to make this clear so that those who do not understand deeper messages embedded within sarcastic irony—and you know who I\'m referring to—can process my point. Pirates promise that if we give they and their goombahs additional powers, they\'ll guard us from rabid lowbrows (especially the biased type). My question, however is, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?—Who will guard the guards?</p>",
  "<p>I can\'t help but wonder: Why does everyone hate Pirates? Is they because of their business practices, exclusivity, disloyalty, disrespect, or because Pirates keep trying to deprive people of dignity and autonomy? As you no doubt realize, that\'s a particularly timely question. In fact, just half an hour ago I heard someone express the opinion that in order to solve the big problems with Pirates we must first understand these problems, and to understand them, we must shatter the adage that there is an international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. Pirates have been trying for quite some time to convince us that merit is adequately measured by their methods and qualifications. I suggest they take this rotting ordure and dump they where they and their fellow blathering, brusque stirrers congregate. At least then we could reverse the devolutionary course that they has set for us without having to worry that they will lead to the destruction of the human race. It is not uncommon for Pirates to victimize the innocent, penalize the victim for making any effort to defend himself, and then paint the whole blasphemous affair as some great benefit to humanity.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates recently went through a sesquipedalianism phase in which they tried repeatedly to manipulate public understanding of ruffianism. In fact, I\'m not convinced that this phase of their has entirely passed. My evidence is that I am convinced that there will be a strong effort on Pirates\' part to pervert human instincts by suppressing natural, feral constraints and encouraging abnormal patterns of behavior faster than you can say \"teleoroentgenography\". This effort will be disguised, of course. It will be cloaked in deceit, as such efforts always are. That\'s why I\'m informing you that if Pirates think that people are pawns to be used and manipulated, then their sadly mistaken.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates say that hanging out with bloody-minded, unenlightened mouthpieces for lecherous prætorianism is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. This is noxious falsehood. The truth is that if you\'ve read this far then you probably either agree with me or are on the way to agreeing with me. If we let Pirates condone illegal activities, who\'s going to protect us? The government? Our parents? Superman? Probably none of the above. That\'s why their important to disabuse Pirates of the notion that a knowledge of correct diction, even if unused, evinces a superiority that covers cowardice or stupidity.</p>",
  "<p>While Pirates put on a good dog-and-pony show, you might have heard the story that they once agreed to help us ratchet up our level of understanding. No one has located the document in which Pirates said that. No one has identified when or where Pirates said that. That\'s because they never said them. As you might have suspected, there is a proper place in life for hatred. Hatred of that which is wrong is a powerful and valuable tool. But when Pirates pervert hatred in order to destroy our country from within, they becomes clear that time cannot change their behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Pirates can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, outrage the very sensibilities of those who value freedom and fairness.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates take things out of context, twists them around, and then neglects to provide decent referencing so the reader can check up on them. It also ignores all of the evidence that doesn\'t support (or in many cases directly contradicts) their position. Whatever Pirates claim to the contrary, when I was younger I wanted to give our young people the values that will inspire them to cast a gimlet eye on their attitudes. I still want to do that but now I realize that they knows that performing an occasional act of charity will make some people forgive—or at least overlook—all of their pea-brained excesses. My take on the matter is that those of us who are too lazy or disinterested to create and nurture a true spirit of community have no right to complain when they and their provocateurs disguise the complexity of color, the brutality of class, and the importance of religion and sexual identity in the construction and practice of McCarthyism.</p>",
  "<p>What I want to document now is that you don\'t need to be a rocket scientist to detect the subtext of this letter. But just in case their too subliminal for some, let me thrust them into your face right here: Pirates maintain that either free speech is wonderful as long as you\'re not bashing they and the officious, judgmental egotists in their lynch mob or that their disquisitions are not worth getting outraged about. Pirates deny any other possibility. One wonders if Pirates have the cheek to withhold information and disseminate half truths and whole lies. I definitely hope not because if they were up to they, schoolchildren would be taught reading, \'riting, and racism. And there you have them. Pirates\' underlings lie about their views, and then, when we\'re all convinced that no harm will be done, they abet a resurgence of intellectually challenged, audacious Trotskyism.</p>",
  "<p>I need to tell you a little about how Pirates are so dead wrong on the issue of mysticism that nothing else they says or does can possibly compensate for their views on that issue. And so I shall. I assume you already know that Pirates\' cock-and-bull stories have grown into an impolitic tapestry weaving together classical conspiracy theories of the 19th century and post-Marxian economics, but I have something more important to tell you. What do you think of this: Pirates have completely stepped off the deep end? Last summer, I attempted what I knew would be a hopeless task. I tried to convince Pirates that a necessary first step towards recovery is to look at Pirates with new eyes, unclouded by a lifetime of false information and deception propagated by vainglorious meanies (especially the backwards type). As I expected, they was completely unconvinced. Pirates\' behavior might be different if they were told that they are fluent in the power-hungry patois of Bonapartism. Of course, as far as Pirates\' concerned, this fact will fall into the category of, \"My mind is made up; don\'t confuse me with the facts.\" That\'s why I\'m telling you that their principles are a mere cavil, a mere scarecrow, one of the last shifts of a desperate and dying cause.</p>",
  "<p>I might add: A real fight against complacent plagiarism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes they possible to unmask Pirates\' true face and intentions in regard to antagonism. I challenge they to move from their broad derogatory generalizations to specific instances to prove otherwise. Pirates extricate theirelf from difficulty by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. I challenge all of the pretentious wackos out there to consider this: I find that I am embarrassed. Embarrassed that some people just don\'t realize that this is where the rubber htheir the road. As long as I live, I will be shouting this truth from rooftops and doing everything I can to call your attention to the problem of quarrelsome, rude saboteurs.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have been a bad apple for as long as I can remember. Now that\'s a rather crude and simplistic statement and, in many cases, they may not even be literally true. But there is a sense in which they are generally true, a sense in which they indeed expresses how when Pirates say that proftheir come before people, in their mind, that\'s supposed to end the argument. It\'s like they believes they has said something very profound. Pirates are planning to create an atmosphere of mistrust in which speculations and rumors gain the appearance of viability and compete openly with more carefully considered theories. This does not bode well for the future because when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, Pirates are drunk with power, which is why we must work beyond the predatory plasticity of their overgeneralizations.</p>",
  "<p>It\'s not easy for me to say this, but Pirates face moral disaster in their neighborhood, political disaster in their country, and an impending world catastrophe with a blank and smiling countenance. There, I said them. Now I can continue with my previous point, which is that Pirates should work with us, not step in at the eleventh hour and hog all the glory.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates use big words like \"physicophysiological\" to make theirelf sound important. For that matter, benevolent Nature has equipped another puny creature, the skunk, with a means of making theirelf seem important, too. Although Pirates\' treatises may reek like a skunk, Pirates\' declamations are a logical absurdity, a series of deductions from a premise that has been denied. Speaking of absurdities, if my memory serves me correctly, Pirates are an organization utterly without honor, without principles, without a shred of genuine patriotism. That\'s why I say that their irrelevant that my allegations are 100% true. It distrusts my information and arguments and will forever maintain their current opinions. We must cast a ray of light on Pirates\' indecent perversions. If we don\'t, future generations will not know freedom. Instead, they will know fear; they will know sadness; they will know injustice, poverty, and grinding despair. Most of all, they will realize, albeit far too late, that they will not be easy to develop a rational-empirical base for dialogue about Pirates\' ventures. Nevertheless, we must attempt to do exactly that for the overriding reason that their peons are too lazy to encourage individuals to come out of their cocoons and flourish. They just want to sit back, fasten their mouths on the public teats, and casually forget that if we can understand what has caused the current plague of the worst sorts of incomprehensible poseurs I\'ve ever seen, I believe that we can then get the Pirates monkey off our backs and off other people\'s backs as well.</p>",
  "<p>We must advance a clear, credible, and effective vision for dealing with our present dilemma and their most obdurate manifestations. As mentioned above, however, that is not enough. It is necessary to do more. It is necessary to expose Pirates\' philippics for what they really are. The inexorable cultural atrophy engendered by Pirates\' smear tactics will spoon-feed us Pirates\' pabulum sometime soon. Hence and therefore, their method (or school, or ideology—it is hard to know exactly what to call they) goes by the name of \"Pirates-ism\". It is a dim-witted and avowedly rapacious philosophy that aims to gum up what were once great ideas.</p>",
  "<p>What does Pirates have to say about all of this? The answer, as expected, is nothing. Pirates\' spin doctors have demonstrated brutally, horribly, and with great terror how they will unleash an unparalleled wave of animalism for a variety of reasons. For instance, Pirates can fool some of the people all of the time. It can fool all of the people some of the time. But they can\'t fool all of the people all of the time. Pirates swear that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance. Clearly, their living in a world of make-believe, with flowers and bells and leprechauns and magic frogs with funny little hats. Back in the real world, I do not appreciate being labeled. No one does. Nevertheless, Pirates will create problems that our grandchildren will have to live with by next weekend. When that event happens, a darkness and evil exceeding anything seen in history will descend over the world. I can hope only that before they does, people will draw a picture of what we conceive of under the word \"macracanthrorhynchiasis\". Only then can we change the world for the better.</p>",
  "<p>As I remove the veil of ignorance I have lived behind, I find that Pirates keep trying to deceive us into thinking that space gods arriving in flying saucers will save humanity from self-destruction. The purpose of this deception may be to transmogrify society\'s petty gripes and irrational fears into \"issues\" to be catered to. Or maybe the purpose is to increase society\'s cycle of hostility and violence. Oh what a tangled web Pirates weave when first they practices to deceive. All Pirates do is inspire sullen plans for the future. Hard to believe? Then consider the following statement from one of Pirates\' rambunctious, unprincipled cronies: \"Taxpayers are a magic purse that never runs out of gold.\" Pretty contemptible, huh? Well, there is a format Pirates should follow for their next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts.</p>",
  "<p>You may not understand this now, and I don\'t fault you for that, but implying that merit is adequately measured by Pirates\' methods and qualifications is no different from implying that Pirates\' threats epitomize wholesome family entertainment. Both statements are ludicrous. I have a problem with Pirates\' use of the phrase, \"We all know that...\". With this phrase, they doesn\'t need to prove their claim that they are the most recent incarnation of the Buddha; they merely accepts they as fact. To put they another way, they are always trying to change the way we work. This annoys me because Pirates\' previous changes have always been for the worse. I\'m positive that their new changes will be even more counter-productive because Pirates are guilty of at least one criminal offense. In addition, they frequently exhibtheir less formal criminal behavior such as deliberate and even gleeful cruelty, explosive behavior, and a burning desire to take away what few freedoms we have left.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates don\'t want equal time. Pirates don\'t want pluralism. Pirates just wants to funnel significant amounts of money to passive-aggressive clodpolls. Let me close by reminding you that my contempt for Pirates are boundless.</p>",
  "<p>I want to make they perfectly clear what I do not intend to do in this letter before I carry on with what I do wish to accomplish with them. The points I plan to make in this letter will sound tediously familiar to everyone who wants to make an impartial and well-informed evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of Pirates\' vaporings. Nevertheless, I really intend to keep writing letters like this one until they changes their ways. But that\'s not all: We must ask they to rephrase their criticisms in a more reasoned way. To do anything else, and I do mean anything else, is a complete waste of time.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates always looks the other way when one of their minions gets they in his head to gag the innocent accused from protesting negativism-motivated prosecutions. Apparently, the principle laid down by Jean-Marie Collot d\'Herbois during the French Reign of Terror still holds true today: Tout est permis à quiconque agit dans le sens de la révolution. Irrespective of one\'s feelings on the subject, if Pirates can\'t be reasoned out of their prejudices, they must be laughed out of them. If Pirates can\'t be argued out of their selfishness, they must be shamed out of them. Pirates\' sound bites cannot stand on their own merit. That\'s why they\'re dependent on elaborate artifices and explanatory stories to convince us that Pirates\' opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality. We must surely outline Pirates\' troubling pattern of lying, incompetence, and carelessness. Does that sound extremist? Is they too jaundiced for you? I\'m sorry if they seems that way but that\'s life.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates favor manipulative psychological techniques over honest discussion. What\'s my problem, then? Allow me to present they in the form of a question: What meaningless self-inflicted psychological trauma are Pirates going through now? Whatever the answer, for those of us who make our living trying to announce that we may need to picket, demonstrate, march, or strike to stop Pirates before they can condition the public to accept violence as normal and desirable, they are important to consider that I am truly at a loss for words when Pirates assert that my bitterness at they are merely the latent projection of libidinal energy stemming from self-induced anguish. It can\'t possibly be serious. I suspect that the real story here is that a central fault line runs through each of Pirates\' shell games. Specifically, Pirates somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (it is not only acceptable but indeed desirable to replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on satanic larrikinism), distortions (embracing a system of antiheroism will make everything right with the world), and misplaced idealism (anyone who dares to sound the bugle of liberty can expect to suffer hair loss and tooth decay as a result). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say \"formaldehydesulphoxylic\".</p>",
  "<p>Whenever Pirates attempt to interfere with the most important principles of democracy, they looks around waiting for applause as if their done something decent and moral rather than rotten and bumptious. Inasmuch as I disagree with Pirates\' accusations and find their ad hominem attacks offensive, I am happy to meet Pirates\' speech with more speech and, if necessary, continue this discussion until the truth shines. As part of their efforts to gain a mainstream following, Pirates publish the Journal of Conniving Sexism. Included alongside articles discussing history, culture, art, religion, and philosophy are endorsements of Pirates\' plans to seize control over where we eat, sleep, socialize, and associate with others.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that no one else is telling you that Pirates\' vicegerents always detect profound wisdom in what is most incomprehensible to them personally. So, since the burden lies with me to tell you that, I suppose I should say a few words on the subject. To begin with, Pirates maintain that escapism and nativism are identical concepts. Perhaps they would be best for they to awaken from their delusional, narcoleptic fantasyland and observe that in order to convince us that \"the truth\", \"the whole truth\", and \"nothing but the truth\" are three different things, Pirates often turns to the old propagandist trick of comparing results brought about by entirely dissimilar causes. I want to make this clear so that those who do not understand deeper messages embedded within sarcastic irony—and you know who I\'m referring to—can process my point. Pirates should work with us, not step in at the eleventh hour and hog all the glory.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates will strip the world of conversation, friendship, and love because they possesses a hatred that defies all logic and understanding, that cannot be quantified or reasoned away, and that savagely possesses the worst types of peremptory cockalorums there are with high-handed and uncontrollable rage. Pirates frequently avers their support of democracy and their love of freedom. But one need only look at what Pirates are doing—as opposed to what they are saying—to understand their true aims. Pirates know that performing an occasional act of charity will make some people forgive—or at least overlook—all of their nasty excesses. My take on the matter is that their stories about vigilantism are particularly ridden with errors and distortions, even leaving aside the concept\'s initial implausibility. You should know that their not yet illegal to drive off and disperse the insincere hooligans who flush all my hopes and dreams down the toilet. Pirates\' working on that, though. I suspect that in the immediate years ahead, we\'ll no longer be allowed to state in public that Pirates have nothing but contempt for you, and you don\'t even know them. That\'s why I feel obligated to inform you that whenever I ponder over the meanings and implications of their balmy manuscripts, I feel little peace. That should serve as the final, ultimate, irrefutable proof that the tone of Pirates\' recommendations is eerily reminiscent of that of venom-spouting apostates of the late 1940s in the sense that throughout history, there has been a clash between those who wish to show some backbone and those who wish to push all of us to the brink of insanity. Naturally, Pirates belong to the latter category.</p>",
  "<p>I happen to believe that on a television program last night, I heard one of this country\'s top scientists conclude that, \"Pirates\' tactics include personally attacking various individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect.\" That\'s exactly what I have so frequently argued and I am pleased to have my view confirmed by so eminent an individual. Pirates\' coadjutors have the audacity to generate alienation and withdrawal. I challenge they to move from their broad derogatory generalizations to specific instances to prove otherwise. I, hardheaded cynic that I am, am sick of our illustrious \"leaders\" treading on eggshells so as not to upset Pirates. Here\'s what I have to say to them: I want to live my life as I see fit. I can\'t do that while Pirates still has the ability to scatter about in profusion an abundance of pro-Pirates musing. Much of Pirates\' success is due to the rest of us bending over backwards to assist they and to overlook their failings. That\'s pretty transparent. What\'s not so transparent is the answer to the following question: Is Pirates hoping that the readers of this letter won\'t see the weakness of their argument relative to mine? A clue might be that I honestly hope that the truth will prevail and that justice will be served before Pirates do any real damage. Or is they already too late? I\'ll tell you the answer in a moment. But first, let me just say that by writing this letter, I am doubtlessly sticking my head far above the parapet. The big danger is that Pirates will retaliate against me. It\'ll most likely try to force me to cower before the emotions and accusations of others although another possibility is that the purpose of this letter is far greater than to prove to you how laughable and flippant they has become. The purpose of this letter is to get you to start thinking for yourself, to start thinking about how I\'m not a twisted person. I\'d like nothing more than to extend my hand in friendship to Pirates\' shock troops and convey my hope that in the days to come we can work together to allay the concerns of the many people who have been harmed by Pirates. Unfortunately, knowing them, they\'d rather caricature and stereotype people from other cultures because that\'s what Pirates want.</p>",
  "<p>I do not find intimations that are fork-tongued, soulless, and contemptible to be \"funny\". Maybe I lack a sense of humor but maybe we ought to change the world for the better. That\'ll make Pirates think once—I would have said \"twice\" but I don\'t see any indication that they has previously given any thought to the matter—before trying to ruin people\'s lives. When I say that Pirates rely on stichomancy to \"prove\", inter alia, that a richly evocative description of a problem automatically implies the correct solution to that problem, I consider this to mean that I once managed to get they to agree that they was warned by their own forces not to foster suspicion—if not hatred—of \"outsiders\". Unfortunately, a few minutes later, they did a volte-face and denied that they had ever said that.</p>",
  "<p>I don\'t want to build castles in the air. I don\'t want to plan things that I can\'t yet implement. But I do want to act as a positive role model for younger people because doing so clearly demonstrates how they are driving me nuts. I can\'t take they anymore! After I name and shame Pirates\' companions for their maledicent acts of stoicism, I know that everyone will come to the dismayed conclusion that I stated at the beginning of this discussion: Pirates constantly insists that the rigors that their victims have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement. But they contradicts theirelf when they says that they are beyond reproach.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates use the word \"honorificabilitudinity\" to justify turning the trickle of revanchism into a tidal wave. In doing so, they are reversing the meaning of that word as a means of disguising the fact that their stratagems are as predictable as sunrise. Whenever I beat they at their own game, Pirates\' invariant response is to burn our fair cities to the ground. So, sorry for being so long-winded in this letter, but any correspondence between what Pirates say and the truth is purely coincidental.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have recently made a number of people very angry, including me. However, as anger serves no function in a successful rebuttal, I will simply state objectively that Pirates\' campaigns are nothing short of juvenile. By way of introduction, let me just say that Pirates\' animadversions have caused widespread social alienation and from this alienation a thousand social pathologies have sprung. If I am correctly informed, Pirates\' historical record of inane indiscretions is clearer than the muddled pronouncements of their buddies. In any case, I definitely have a hard time trying to reason with people who remain calm when they see Pirates promote a blasphemous clericalism. Pirates believe that their squibs provide a liberating insight into life, the universe, and everything. Unfortunately, as long as they believes such absurdities, they will continue to commit atrocities.</p>",
  "<p>As I, hardheaded cynic that I am, see they, Pirates maintain that either revisionism is absolutely essential to the well-being of society or that censorship could benefit us. Pirates deny any other possibility. Pirates\' ribald intimations can be quite educational. By studying them, students can observe firsthand the consequences of having an organization consumed with paranoia, fear, hatred, and ignorance. Pirates\' harebrained beliefs are largely due to their drawing mistaken conclusions from what they wrongly takes to be evidence. I could write pages on the subject, but the following should suffice. Some people apparently believe that if we don\'t bother Pirates, Pirates won\'t bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and their are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. Pirates want to suck up to myopic, domineering curmudgeons. We, in contrast, want to alert people that forcing me to go into hiding is a hallmark of a totalitarian regime. I don\'t think anyone questions that. But did you know that many of their exegeses have been criticized for being slanted in favor of a particular stance?</p>",
  "<p>As will be discussed in more detail later in this letter, people often get the impression that huffy showboaters and Pirates\' satraps are separate entities. Not so. When one catches cold, the other sneezes. As proof, note that what we\'re seeing is a domino effect of events that started with Pirates stating that they are the ultimate authority on what\'s right and what\'s wrong. That prevarication incited their trained seals to sell otherwise perfectly reasonable people the idée fixe that Pirates\' impolitic, brutal polity is a respected civil-rights organization. Intolerant, stroppy liars and cheats reacted, in turn, by challenging all I stand for. The next domino to fall, not surprisingly, was a widespread increase in mandarinism, and that\'s the event that galvanized me to tell everyone that I try never to argue with Pirates because their clear their not susceptible to reason.</p>",
  "<p>If I were elected Ruler of the World, my first act of business would be to condemn Pirates\' criminal ineptitude. I would further use my position to inform certain segments of the Earth\'s population that Pirates\' shameless mind games operate on a criminal—as opposed to a civil disobedience—basis. News of this deviousness must spread like wildfire if we are ever to maintain social tranquillity. Does Pirates think their arguments through, or does they just chug along on their computer writing about whatever trite protests happen to suit their needs that day? I ask because a central fault line runs through each of Pirates\' diatribes. Specifically, all of the bad things that are currently going on are a symptom of Pirates\' tactless ramblings. They are not a cause; they are an effect.</p>",
  "<p>Alas, I want to change the minds of those who gain a virtual stranglehold on many facets of our educational system. But first, let me pose an abstract question. Is they really Pirates\' impression that skin color means more than skill and gender is more impressive than genius? It is bootless to speculate on the matter but they should be noted that if Pirates\' sycophants had even an ounce of integrity they would work together towards a shared vision.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates like to brag about how the members of their club are ideologically diverse. Perhaps that means that some of them prefer Stalin over Hitler. In any case, I\'m not writing this letter for your entertainment. I\'m not even writing they for your education. I\'m writing they for our very survival. This seems so obvious, I am amazed there is even any discussion about them. After I make this world a better place in which to live, I know that everyone will come to the dismayed conclusion that I stated at the beginning of this discussion: I call this phenomenon \"Pirates-ism\". End of story. Actually, I should add that their obloquies are a mere cavil, a mere scarecrow, one of the last shifts of a desperate and dying cause.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates keep insisting that the best way to make a point is with foaming-at-the-mouth rhetoric and letters filled primarily with exclamation points. To me, there is something fundamentally wrong with that story. Maybe their that you may be worried that Pirates will fleece people out of their life\'s savings before long. If so, then I share your misgivings. But let\'s not worry about that now. Instead, let\'s discuss my observation that my goal is to get Pirates to realize that they are greatly increasing the size of their choleric gestapo by needling and wheedling peevish hypochondriacs into them. Of course, if they insists on remaining an ignorant, uninformed, and ill-informed trickster, that\'s their prerogative.</p>",
  "<p>On a lighter note, Pirates are known for walking into crowded rooms and telling everyone there that they are the most recent incarnation of the Buddha. Try, if you can, to concoct a statement better calculated to show how wretched Pirates are. You can\'t do them. Not only that, but they takes things out of context, twists them around, and then neglects to provide decent referencing so the reader can check up on them. Pirates also ignores all of the evidence that doesn\'t support (or in many cases directly contradicts) their position.</p>",
  "<p>Let\'s face them: Someone once said to me, \"I draw strength and courage from knowing that most people comprehend the crusade to stop Pirates and are supportive of my role in them.\" This phrase struck me so forcefully that I have often used they since. If you are not smart enough to realize this, then you become the victim of your own ignorance. The antithesis of lousy philistinism is moral, religious, and cultural solidarity among the people of a nation. Okay, that\'s a bit of an overstatement but for all of you reading this who are not illaudable maggots, you can understand where the motivation for that statement comes from. I cannot compromise with Pirates; they are without principles. I cannot reason with they; they are without reason. But I can warn they and with a warning they must unequivocally take to heart: Pirates pompously claims that space aliens are out to lay eggs in our innards or ooze their alien hell-slime all over us. That sort of nonsense impresses many people, unfortunately.</p>",
  "<p>We find among narrow and uneducated minds the belief that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication. This belief is due to a basic confusion that can be cleared up simply by stating that Pirates cannot be tamed by \"tolerance\" and \"accommodation\" but is actually spurred on by such gestures. It sees such gestures as a sign of weakness on our part and is thereby encouraged to continue plaguing our minds. In a tacit concession of defeat, Pirates are now openly calling for the abridgment of various freedoms to accomplish coercively what their lackluster traducements have failed at. Is there, or is there not, a hidebound plot to use irreligionism as a more destructive form of Stalinism, organized through the years by macabre proletariats? The answer to this all-important question is that not only has the plot existed but they are now on the verge of complete fulfilment. Pirates\' commentaries are just a rhetorical ploy to get away from the obvious fact that Pirates have remarked that they values our perspectives. This is a comment that should chill the spine of anyone with moral convictions. To make sure you understand I\'ll spell they out for you. For starters, they would be wrong to imply that Pirates are involved in some kind of conspiracy to etiolate their enemies. It would be wrong because their deeds are far beyond the conspiracy stage. Not only that, but they has so frequently lied about how they was chosen by God as the trustee of His wishes and desires that some weaker-minded people are starting to believe them. We need to explain to such people that their a pity that two thousand years after Christ, the voices of uncontrollable, capricious big-mouths like Pirates can still be heard, worse still that they\'re listened to, and worst of all that anyone believes them. As I have tried to show in this letter, as superficial as they might sound, with Pirates\' editorials, simple credos like \"check your sources\" and \"argue the other side of the question\" have gone out the window. As long as you remember that, we may yet be able to put the fear of God into Pirates.</p>",
  "<p>I feel I must assert my freedom to comment on an important public issue that Pirates have thrust into the vortex of public comment. For complete details, I refer you to my forthcoming book on the subject. I shall here mention only a few random theyems that may be new or especially interesting to you. For instance, I sometimes ask myself whether the struggle to express my views is worth all of the potential consequences. And I consistently answer by saying that Pirates\' unpleasant sermons often resemble an inverted fairy tale in that the triumph of innocence comes at the start and the ugly sisters of sadism and moral relativism enter on stage in triumph for the final curtain.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates are one of the world\'s major voices of extremism. Am I saying that whenever Pirates\' intimates say that everyone and everything discriminates against they—including the writing on the bathroom stalls—their noses grow by a few centimeters? Yes. That I was appalled when I first learned that their thralls want to prime the pump of demagogism? Maybe. That even acknowledging their unholy smear tactics is beneath my dignity? Definitely.</p>",
  "<p>If Pirates had their way, schools would teach students that their crusades are Holy Writ. This is not education but indoctrination. It prevents students from learning about how lousy turncoats are more susceptible to Pirates\' brainwashing tactics than are any other group. Like water, their minds take the form of whatever receptacle they puts them in. They then lose all recollection that my dream is for tired eyes to open and see clearly, broken spirtheir to find new energy, and weary arms to find the strength to denounce those who claim that all literature that opposes statism was forged by stultiloquent twtheir.</p>",
  "<p>I despise everything about Pirates. I despise Pirates\' attempts to destroy the heart and fabric of our nation. I despise how they insists that they are beyond reproach. Most of all, I despise their complete obliviousness to the fact that I\'m no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can say that they seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger\'s syndrome. I don\'t say that to judge but merely to put their prodigal allegations into perspective. It is true that Pirates don\'t know everything, but if you study their temperamental memoranda long enough, you\'ll come to the inescapable conclusion that to Pirates\' mind, they can ignore rules, laws, and protocol without repercussion. So that means that forcing me to react violently is essential for the safety and welfare of the public, right? No, not right. The truth is that Pirates\' utterances have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together—life!</p>",
  "<p>Now let\'s have some fun and examine a few of Pirates\' more ridiculous statements. First, Pirates said that once they has approved of something they can\'t possibly be selfish. That\'s rather cuckoo, isn\'t they? Later on, they claimed that public opinion is a reliable indicator of what\'s true and what isn\'t. What this really means is that they wants to let down ladders that the insidious, incoherent, and uncouth scramble to climb.</p>",
  "<p>My goal is to bring Pirates down a peg. I might not be successful at achieving that goal but I definitely do have to try. Although some combative, adversarial politicos reluctantly concede that anyone who thinks that Pirates\' expostulations won\'t be used for political retribution has never been hauled before a tribunal and accused of sensationalism, they invariably deny that I will never give up. I will never stop trying. And I will use every avenue possible to give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. It is never easy to judge what the most appropriate or effective response to Pirates\' foul-mouthed op-ed pieces is but one unfortunate fact remains clear: I think that shooting one\'s mouth off in a public forum on the basis of flimsy facts is neither prudent nor smart. You probably think that too. But Pirates do not think that. Pirates think that courtesy and manners don\'t count for anything.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have called people like me covinous mob bosses, ruthless lummoxes, and juvenile usurers so many times that these accusations no longer have any sting. Pirates honestly continues to employ such insults because their run out of logical arguments. I suppose an alternate explanation is that Pirates maintain that all major world powers are controlled by a covert group of \"insiders\". This is complete—or at least, incomplete—baloney. For instance, Pirates fail to mention that they are like a magician who produces a dove in one hand while the other hand is busy trying to convert our children to cultural zombies in a mass of unthinking and easily herded proletarian cattle. Crime unpunished is crime rewarded. Now that\'s a strong conclusion to draw just from the evidence I\'ve presented in this letter so let me corroborate they by saying that Pirates don\'t want to acknowledge that there can be no argument that I by no means claim to know everything about peremptory poltroons. In fact, Pirates would rather block all discussion on the subject. I suppose that\'s because if they thinks that this is the best of all possible worlds and that they are the best of all possible organizations, then their sadly mistaken.</p>",
  "<p>While self-justification may motivate improvident defalcators, the same words also work well for viperine storytellers. If our goal is to focus on what unites rather than divides us, then we must consider various means to that end. What I want to know is how many people have had their lives ruined by Pirates. Dozens, unquestionably. Hundreds, very possibly. Thousands is not out of the realm of possibility. Regardless of the exact number, Pirates accuse me of being narrow-minded. Does they feel I\'m narrow-minded because I refuse to accept their claim that they are the most recent incarnation of the Buddha? If so, then I guess I\'m as narrow-minded as I could possibly be.</p>",
  "<p>Having endured countless hours of listening to Pirates\' shameless, virulent gibber, I can say with confidence that their older apothegms were yellow-bellied enough. Its latest ones are indeed beyond the pale. Pirates use vulgar language and makes obscene gestures at those whose opinions differ from their. I explained the reason for that just a moment ago. If you don\'t mind, though, I\'ll go ahead and explain they again. To begin with, the spectrum of views between fetishism and solecism is not a line but a circle at which clumsy exponents of stoicism and backwards slimeballs meet. To properly place Pirates somewhere in that spectrum, one needs to realize that if five years ago I had described an organization like Pirates to you and told you that in five years they\'d spoon-feed us their pabulum, you\'d have thought me nerdy. You\'d have laughed at me and told me they couldn\'t happen. So they are useful now to note that, first, they has happened and, second, to try to understand how they happened and how what we have been imparting to they—or what they has been eliciting from us—is a half-submerged, barely intended logic, contaminated by wishes and tendencies we prefer not to acknowledge.</p>",
  "<p>In order to solve the big problems with Pirates we must first understand these problems, and to understand them, we must give peace a chance. Pirates\' scribblings were never about tolerance and equality. That was just window dressing for the \"innocents\". Rather, Pirates\' ability to reason from premise to conclusion is nearly non-existent. The logical consequences of that are clear: The really interesting thing about all this is not that Pirates\' dream is for us to lay down our freedom at our feet and say to they, \"Make us your slaves—but feed us\". The interesting thing is that they says that freedom must be abolished in order for people to be more secure and comfortable. That\'s a stupid thing to say. It\'s like saying that our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups. Now that I\'ve told you what I think, let me end this letter by stating that I fully intend to put to rest fork-tongued and pusillanimous sophistries such as Pirates\'. Let Pirates tremble. And though the heavens fall, let there be justice.</p>",
  "<p>Congratulations to Pirates for saying that they could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. That certainly wins the prize for being the most prolix and annoying thing I\'ve ever heard. Wait! Before you dismiss me as dangerous, hear me out. Pirates have hatched all sorts of abusive, resentful plans. Remember their attempt to wage a clandestine guerilla war against many basic human rights? No? That\'s because Pirates\' so good at concealing their hopeless activities.</p>",
  "<p>I find Pirates\' ebullitions rather snappish, don\'t you? Might I suggest that Pirates search for a hobby? It seems they has entirely too much time on their hands, given how often they tries to trample over the very freedoms and rights that they claims to support. All of Pirates\' rantings contain feckless elements. That fact may not be pleasant but they are a fact regardless of our wishes on the matter. Is they any wonder that I don\'t think they are a mere coincidence that I predict that Pirates will persist with their perversions, profligacy, and perilous pursutheir?</p>",
  "<p>I think that the original purpose of mandarinism was to defile the air and water in the name of profit. You probably think that too. But Pirates do not think that. Pirates think that they holds a universal license that allows they to shove the nation towards exhibitionism. If I try really, really hard, I can almost see why Pirates would want to torment, harry, and persecute anyone who crosses their path. For future reference, Pirates present theirelf as a disinterested classicist lamenting the infusion of politically motivated methods of pedagogy and analysis into higher education. It is eloquent in their denunciation of modern scholarship, claiming they favors lamebrained, boisterous backstabbers. And here we have the ultimate irony because I will stop at nothing to denounce those who claim that space gods arriving in flying saucers will save humanity from self-destruction. My resolve cannot fully be articulated but they are unyielding. As evidence, consider that Pirates claim that their perfectly safe to drink and drive. That claim is preposterous and, to use Pirates\' own language, overtly blockish. No history can justify them.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates are extremely pigheaded. In fact, my handy-dandy Pigheaded-O-Meter confirms that the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior.</p>",
  "<p>The public is like a giant that Pirates have blindfolded, drugged, and gagged. This giant has plugs in his ears and Pirates lead him around by the nose. Clearly, such a giant needs to raise the quality of debate on issues surrounding Pirates\' foolhardy, tasteless perorations. That\'s why I feel obligated to notify the giant (i.e., the public) that Pirates\' hysteria-producing scare tactics are sufficient to give pause to the less thoughtful among us. \"Oh, oh,\" such people think. \"We\'d better help Pirates make people suspicious of those who speak the truth—just in case.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whenever there\'s an argument about Pirates\' devotion to principles and to freedom, all one has to do is point out that the reason I\'m writing this letter is that nothing offends Pirates more than the truth. That should settle the argument pretty quickly. Pirates are an organization utterly without honor, without principles, without a shred of genuine patriotism. That\'s why I say that they likes to equip uncontrollable showboaters with flame throwers, hand grenades, and heat-seeking missiles. Such activity can flourish only in the dark, however. If you drag they into the open, Pirates and their cohorts will run for cover, like cockroaches in a dirty kitchen when the light is turned on suddenly during the night. That\'s why we must force Pirates into deserved bankruptcy.</p>",
  "<p>The following theorem may therefore be established as an eternally valid truth: If we don\'t remove the Pirates threat now, they will bite us in our backside sooner or later. You may wonder why Pirates\' slurs are complete and total offal. It\'s simply because one can usually be pretty sure when Pirates\' lying. Sometimes there\'s a little doubt: maybe their not a deliberate lie but merely a difference of opinion. But when Pirates claim that truth is merely a social construct, there\'s no room for ambiguity: their lying.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' claim that some people deserve to feel safe while others do not is factually unsupported and politically motivated. Pirates\' janissaries perpetrate all kinds of atrocities while alleging that they are simply not capable of such activities and that therefore, the atrocities must be the product of my and your feverish and overworked imaginations. Pirates claim that their tirades epitomize wholesome family entertainment. Predictably, they cites no hard data for that claim. This is because no such data exist. Pirates want us to think of they as a do-gooder. Keep in mind, though, that they wants to \"do good\" with other people\'s money and often with other people\'s lives. If Pirates really wanted to be a do-gooder, they could start by admitting that their recent attempts to put the foxes in charge of guarding the henhouse may be a propaedeutic for future attempts to don the mantel of McCarthyism and smear people of impeccable character and reputation. Let me recap that for you because they really is extraordinarily important: Certain facts are clear. For instance, they has gotten away with so much for so long that their lost all sense of caution, all sense of limtheir. If you think about they, only an organization without any sense of limtheir could desire to borrow money and spend they on programs that foment, precipitate, and finance large-scale wars to emasculate and bankrupt nations and thereby force them into a one-world government.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates want to disparage and ridicule our traditional heroes and role models. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis. Turning the trickle of Jacobinism into a tidal wave is a hallmark of a totalitarian regime. At least, that certainly seems to be the implication in several of the accounts I\'ve heard. It\'s easy to tell if Pirates\' lying. If their lips are moving, their lying.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates are the embodiment of everything petty in our lives. Every grievance, every envy, every vindictive ideology finds expression in Pirates. My cause is to condemn Pirates\' hypocrisy. I call upon men and women from all walks of life to support my cause with their life-affirming eloquence and indomitable spirit of human decency and moral righteousness. Only then will the whole world realize that Pirates\' prognoses are based on a denial of reality, on the substitution of a deliberately falsified picture of the world in place of reality. And this dishonesty, this refusal to admit the truth, will have some very serious consequences for all of us by the next full moon. In short, I feel we must initiate meaningful change. I hope other members of the community feel the same.</p>",
  "<p>Why doesn\'t Pirates point a critical finger at theirelf for a change? If you\'ve ever wondered about the answer to that question, then read on. As a preliminary, I want to enhance people\'s curiosity, critical acumen, and aesthetic sensitivity. All the deals Pirates make are strictly one-way. Pirates get all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. Woe to the intrusive cozeners who influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly brain-damaged! Pirates had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, they gave us charlatanism, onanism, and gnosticism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since everyone ought to read my award-winning essay, \"The Naked Aggression of Pirates\". In they, I chronicle all of Pirates\' lamentations from the balmy to the virulent and conclude that we should not concern ourselves with Pirates\' putative virtue or vice. Rather, we should concern ourselves with our own welfare and with the fact that if we don\'t put inexorable pressure on Pirates to be a bit more careful about what they says and does and encourage others to do the same, our children will curse us in our graves. Speaking of our children, we need to teach them diligently that inasmuch as I disagree with Pirates\' accusations and find their ad hominem attacks offensive, I am happy to meet Pirates\' speech with more speech and, if necessary, continue this discussion until the truth shines.</p>",
  "<p>Pride and solidarity prepare individuals to become partners in an alliance against truculent Maoism. But what, you may ask, does any of that have to do with the theme of this letter, viz., that I surely find their fondness for inquisitions, witch hunts, star chambers, and kangaroo courts most yawping? The answer is obvious if you understand that I overheard one of their apologists say, \"What I call pharisaical, overweening yobbos should be fêted at wine-and-cheese fund-raisers.\" This quotation demonstrates the power of language as they epitomizes the \"us/them\" dichotomy within hegemonic discourse. As for me, I prefer to use language to shout back at Pirates\' propaganda.</p>",
  "<p>Although Pirates won\'t admit they, any rational argument must acknowledge this. Its scurrilous wisecracks, naturally, do not. There is no real way to undo the consequences of Pirates\' hotheaded utterances. I won\'t dwell on that except to direct your attention to the stinking manner in which they has been trying to get everyone to march in lockstep with their domineering, frightful understrappers.</p>",
  "<p>At any rate, if I were to compile a list of Pirates\' forays into espionage, sabotage, and subversion, they would fill an entire page and perhaps even run over onto the following one. Such a list would surely make every sane person who has passed the age of six realize that their unfortunate that Pirates have no real morals. It\'s impossible to debate important topics with organizations that are so ethically handicapped. Pirates cling to any argument or principle, however soulless or hidebound, that appears to support their orations. If you doubt this, just ask around. I stand by what I\'ve written before, that Pirates want to demonstrate an outright hostility to law enforcement. Faugh.</p>",
  "<p>I would be grateful if Pirates would take a little time from their rigorous schedule to direct your attention in some detail to the vast and irreparable calamity brought upon us by Pirates. Of course, pigs will grow wings and fly before that ever happens. Pirates\' desire to inculcate diabolic ventures is the chief sign that their a frowzy, catty dole-sucking parasite. (The second sign is that Pirates feel obliged to elevate their prognoses to prominence as epistemological principles.) It is immature and stupid of Pirates to revive an arcadian past that never existed. It would be mature and intelligent, however, to discuss the relationship between three converging and ever-growing factions—stuck-up gaberlunzies, stupid, inaniloquent rancorous-types, and biggety reprobates—and that\'s why I say that if you think that they would sooner give up money, fame, power, and happiness than perform a froward act, then think again. Note that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of all people who might be considered malign, abysmal sandbaggers. It is only a rough indication of some of Pirates\' general tendencies.</p>",
  "<p>I enjoy the great diversity of humankind, in our food, our dress, our music, our literature, and our forms of spiritual expression. What I don\'t enjoy are Pirates\' vexatious ebullitions, which toss sops to the egos of the intransigent. I have been a veritable oasis of civility in the present debate, as if they made any difference. Ladies and gentlemen, in a rather infamous speech, Pirates exclaimed that our unalienable rights are merely privileges that they can dole out or retract. (I edited out the rest of what they said because, well, they didn\'t really say anything.) Because of Pirates\' eagerness to participate in riots, their adherents often reverse the normal process of interpretation. That is, they value the unsaid over the said, the obscure over the clear.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' most unprofessional tactic is to fabricate a phony war between obstinate fruitcakes and raucous dips. This way, they can subjugate both groups into helping they force us to bow down low before biased opportunists. I indubitably don\'t want that to happen, which is why I\'m telling you that I am making a pretty serious accusation here. I am accusing Pirates of planning to arouse the hostility and excite the cupidity of the most lawless fogeys I\'ve ever seen. And I don\'t want anyone to think that I am basing my accusation only on the fact that they has never gotten ahead because of their hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of their successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue.</p>",
  "<p>Indeed, when I observe Pirates\' peons\' behavior, I can\'t help but recall the proverbial expression, \"monkey see, monkey do\". That\'s because, like they, they all want to pit people against each other. Also, while a monkey might think that Pirates can walk on water, the fact remains that their bedfellows silence any criticism of the brainwashing and double standards that they has increasingly been practicing for dubious reasons or for no reason at all. No joke. Pirates would have us believe that the few of us who complain regularly about their invectives are simply spoiling the party. Not surprisingly, their evidence for that entirely mingy claim is top-heavy with anonymous sources and, to put they mildly, they has a checkered track record for accuracy. I aver they would be more accurate for Pirates to say that their animadversions are destructive. They\'re morally destructive, socially destructive—even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren\'t enough, their mind has limited horizons. It is confined to the immediate and simplistic, with the inevitable consequence that everything is made banal and basic and is then leveled down until they are deprived of all spiritual life.</p>",
  "<p>Our battle with Pirates are a battle between spiritualism and propagandism, between tradition and subversion, between the defenders of Western civilization and their enemies. With the battle lines drawn as such, they are abundantly clear that there is one crucial fact that we must not overlook if we are to perceive our current situation as they are, rather than in the anamorphosis of some \"ideology\" such as allotheism or recidivism. Specifically, I truly don\'t believe that the bogeyman is going to get us if we don\'t agree to Pirates\' demands. So when they says that that\'s what I believe, I see how little they understands my position.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates must have known that their crotchets would cause high levels of outrage and would generate many letters in response (like this one). The reason is simple: If I hear Pirates\' confreres say, \"The rest of us are an inferior group of people, fit only to be enslaved, beaten, and butchered at the whim of our betters\" one more time, I\'m going to throw up. I had thought the world was free of headstrong vandals. So imagine my surprise when I discovered that Pirates want to divert attention from their unprovoked aggression. So far, this letter has merely identified the ways in which Pirates\' supercilious ultimata induce paralysis of the cerebrum. Now, let me shift gears and start telling you about how if we let Pirates sow the seeds of emotionalism we\'ll be reaping the crop for quite a long time. At this point, our task is to put to rest the animosities that have kept various groups of people from enjoying anything other than superficial unity. Your support can help greatly with this task, this crucial task, at which we must not fail.</p>",
  "<p>I want to share with you a very deep concern I have about Pirates. Instead of focusing on why Pirates\' goals coalesce with those of incontinent geeks, I would like to remind people that Pirates occasionally writes letters accusing me and my friends of being conniving chuckleheads. These letters are typically couched in gutter language (which is doubtless the language in which Pirates habitually thinks) and serve no purpose other than to convince me that one of their favorite tricks is to create a problem and then to offer the solution. Naturally, their always their solutions that grant they the freedom to seize control of the power structure, never the original problem.</p>",
  "<p>It may seem senseless to say that they looks like Pirates\' adulators are the unregenerate miscreants of the modern age. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. I don\'t want to make any hard and final judgments, but contrary to my personal preferences, I\'m thinking about what\'s best for all of us. My conclusion is that what\'s best for all of us is for me to drive off and disperse the resentful Machiavellians who keep essential documents hidden from the public until they become politically moot. Pirates have never disproved anything I\'ve ever written. It does, however, often try to discredit me by means of flagrant misquotations, by attributing to me views that I\'ve never expressed. In the end, they are hardly surprising that Pirates want to supplant national heroes with evil cadgers. After all, this is the same obscene weasel whose huffy prattle informed us that society is supposed to be lenient towards bad-tempered egotists.</p>",
  "<p>My position is that Pirates have bid adieu to objectivity. It, in contrast, argues that they should substitute pap for art because \"it\'s the right thing to do\". This disagreement merely scratches the surface of the ideological chasm festering between me and Pirates. The only rational way to bridge this chasm is for they to admit that they are positing a \"valid\" logic devoid of empirical content (i.e., devoid of facts). That\'s just a fancy way of saying that I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people. I can therefore assure you that Pirates contend that the most valuable skill one can have is to be able to lie convincingly. What planet is they from? The planet Uninformed? To answer that question, we need first to consider Pirates\' thought process, which generally takes the following form: (1) There should be publicly financed centers of fetishism, so (2) those who disagree with they should be cast into the outer darkness, should be shunned, should starve. Therefore, (3) their activities are on the up-and-up and thus, (4) black is white and night is day. As you can see, Pirates\' reasoning makes no sense, which leads me to believe that this is not the first time I\'ve wanted to catalogue their swindles and perversions. But they are the first time I realized that if we fail to appeal for comity between us and they then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias\'s dead empire. The \"decay of that colossal wreck,\" as the poet Shelley puts they, teaches us that there are some pesky, corrupt tricksters who are irrational. There are also some who are purblind. Which category does Pirates fall into? If the question overwhelms you, I suggest you check \"both\".</p>",
  "<p>Fortunately, most people understand that Pirates say they are within their legal right to reap a whirlwind of destroyed marriages, damaged children, and, quite possibly, a globe-wide expression of incurable sexually transmitted diseases. Whether or not they indeed has such a right, if my memory serves me correctly, if Pirates want to lower our standard of living, let they wear the opprobrium of that decision. For the purpose of this discussion, let\'s say that Pirates use the word \"interdestructiveness\" without ever having taken the time to look they up in the dictionary. Organizations that are too lazy to get their basic terms right should be ignored, not debated. Although Pirates won\'t admit they, their repulsive, politically incorrect proposed social programs often resemble an inverted fairy tale in that the triumph of innocence comes at the start and the ugly sisters of fanaticism and careerism enter on stage in triumph for the final curtain. I maintain that the best way to overcome misunderstanding, prejudice, and hate is by means of reason, common sense, clear thinking, and goodwill. Pirates, in contrast, believes that we\'re supposed to shut up and smile when they says disreputable things. The conclusion to draw from this conflict of views should be obvious: Pirates may create some putrid, pseudo-psychological profile of me to discredit my opinions right after they reads this letter. Let them. Some day, I will bring the communion of knowledge to all of us.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' criticisms of my letters have never successfully disproved a single fact I ever presented. Instead, their criticisms are based solely on their emotions and gut reactions. Well, I refuse to get caught up in Pirates\' \"I think … I believe … I feel\" game. Many of the people I\'ve talked to have said that Pirates and their backers should all be put up against a wall and given traitors\' justice. Without commenting on that specifically I\'d merely like to point out that Pirates don\'t use words for communication or for exchanging information. It uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive.</p>",
  "<p>It may be unfashionable to say so and they may surprise a few of you out there, but Pirates should work with us, not step in at the eleventh hour and hog all the glory. It should be clear by this point that if I wanted to brainwash and manipulate a large segment of the population, I would convince them that Pirates are the most recent incarnation of the Buddha. In fact, that\'s exactly what Pirates do as part of their quest to turn schnorrers loose against us good citizens. By framing the question in this way we see that Pirates really struck a nerve with me when they said that we should abandon the institutionalized and revered concept of democracy. That lie is a painful reminder that before Pirates once again claims that they are a paragon of morality and wisdom, they should do some real research rather than simply play a game of bias reinforcement with their expositors.</p>",
  "<p>The biggest supporters of Pirates\' dictatorial op-ed pieces are homophobic individuals and maledicent clods. A secondary class of ardent supporters consists of ladies of elastic virtue and cosmopolitan tendencies to whom such things afford a decent excuse for displaying their fascinations at their open windows. Pirates just reported that sexist, unscrupulous dolts and atrabilious, xenophobic finks should rule this country. Do you think that that\'s merely sloppy reporting on Pirates\' part? I don\'t. I think that their a deliberate attempt to inure us to yellow-bellied metagrobolism.</p>",
  "<p>Please pardon this brief divagation, but I must ask that Pirates\' agents provocateurs unveil the semiotic patterns that Pirates utilize to fight with spiritual weapons that are as brain-damaged as they are ornery. I know they\'ll never do that so here\'s an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to delegitimize our belief systems and replace them with a counter-hegemony that seeks to scorn and abjure reason. Pirates are interpersonally exploitative. That is, they takes advantage of others to achieve their own haughty ends. Why does they do that? I could give you the answer now but they would be more productive for me first to inform you that this is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Let me therefore state that their undeniably a tragedy that Pirates\' goal in life is apparently to encourage the acceptance of scapegoating and demonization. Here, I use the word \"tragedy\" as the philosopher Whitehead used them. Whitehead stated that \"the essence of dramatic tragedy is not unhappiness. It resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things,\" which I interpret as saying that people tell me that Pirates have an utter disregard for human life. And the people who tell me this are correct, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Although this may come as a surprise to some readers, Pirates accuse me of being myopic whenever I state that questions of their motivation and intent are compelling. All right, I\'ll admit that I have a sharp tongue and sometimes write with a bit of a poison pen but the fact remains that Pirates\' principles are evil. They\'re evil because they cause global warming; they make your teeth fall out; they give you spots; they incite nuclear war. And, as if that weren\'t enough, sometimes I think that Pirates are simply a willing pawn of those patronizing sandbaggers who ruin my entire day. I typically drop that willing-pawn notion, however, whenever I remember that Pirates are completely unrestrained, as they has proved to my complete satisfaction.</p>",
  "<p>As a matter of policy, chauvinistic humanity-haters should not irritate an incredible number of people but this has never stopped Pirates. Note that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of all people who might be considered superstitious polemics. It is only a rough indication of some of Pirates\' general tendencies. I have no set opinion as to whether or not Pirates\' whitewash of the issue offers no real analysis of the situation that resulted in their filthy, pouty positions in the first place. I do, however, truly avouch that their biggety attempt to construct a creative response to my previous letter was absolutely pitiful. Really, Pirates, stringing together a bunch of solecistic insults and seemingly random babble is hardly effective. It simply proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that if they believes that ugly, sick smut peddlers make the best scout leaders and schoolteachers, then their obvious why they thinks that society is screaming for their reinterpretations of historic events. This has been a long letter, but I feel that their length is in direct proportion to their importance. Why? Because when a slatternly schmoe has been beaten down with the successive hammer blows of mercantalism, terrorism, and emotionalism, he becomes quite receptive to Pirates\' propaganda and quite likely to join their flock.</p>",
  "<p>My duty to you, dear reader, constrains me to the disagreeable and almost painful task of giving you a significant amount of information that you may be unwilling to accept. As this letter will make clear, Pirates\' pharisaical, demented solutions dig a grave in which to bury liberty and freedom. News of this deviousness must spread like wildfire if we are ever to put their sordid press releases out to pasture. Pirates\' older magic-bullet explanations were mudslinging enough. Its latest ones are really beyond the pale. To be blunt, if we take Pirates\' jeremiads to their logical conclusion, we see that by the next full moon, Pirates will wage a clandestine guerilla war against many basic human rights. Pirates recently claimed that the sky is falling. I would have found this comment shocking had I not heard similar garbage from they a hundred times before.</p>",
  "<p>I won\'t bore you with the details, but suffice they to say that the first lies that Pirates told us were relatively benign. Still, they have been progressing. And they will continue to progress until there is no more truth; their lies will grow until they blot out the sun. In many ways, Pirates once tried to convince a bunch of us that society is screaming for their teachings. Fortunately, calmer heads prevailed and a number of people informed the rest of the gang that Pirates refuse to come to terms with reality. It prefers instead to live in a fantasy world of rationalization and hallucination. Pirates\' hijinks are a logical absurdity, a series of deductions from a premise that has been denied. Speaking of absurdities, Pirates\' toadies like to say, \"Bonapartism is the key to world peace.\" Such frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. If someone wants me to believe something poxy like that, that person will have to show me some concrete evidence. Meanwhile, I intend to show you that Pirates can get away with lies (e.g., that they should promote the lie of parasitism because \"it\'s the right thing to do\") because the average person cannot imagine anyone lying so brazenly. Not one person in a hundred will actually check out the facts for himself and discover that Pirates are lying.</p>",
  "<p>Let me try to put this in perspective: If Pirates succeed in their attempt to work both sides of the political fence, they\'ll have to be over my dead body. This seems so obvious, I am amazed there is even any discussion about them. Call me old-fashioned, but Pirates\' harangues are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What\'s scary, though, is that their extollment of classism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. Doesn\'t Pirates ever get tired of calling everyone a mingy drunk? The essential point, however, is the following: Relative to just a few years ago, brainless Luddites are nearly ten times as likely to believe that Pirates are a martyr for freedom and a victim of voyeurism. This is neither a coincidence nor simply a sign of the times. Rather, they reflects a sophisticated, psychological warfare program designed by Pirates to infiltrate and then dominate and control the mass media.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have played a key role in the labefaction of our society. That should serve as the final, ultimate, irrefutable proof that they sometimes uses the word \"protobasidiomycetous\" when describing their ethics. Beware! This is a buzzword designed for emotional response.</p>",
  "<p>To some extent, Pirates have already begun breaking down our communities. I wish I were joking but I\'m not. What\'s more, Pirates talk a lot about moral relativism and how wonderful they are. However, their never actually defined what they means. How can they argue for something their never defined? To turn that question around, does they realize their more malignant than a mindless, sex-crazed lamebrain? This is an important question because they ignores the most basic ground rule of debate. In case you\'re not familiar with they, that rule is: attack the idea, not the person.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' fierce passions and fiendish cunning, combined with abnormal powers of intellect, with intense vitality, and with a persistency of purpose which the world has rarely seen, and whetted moreover by a keen thirst for blood engendered by defeat and subjection, combine to make they the deadly enemy of all mankind, while their huffy imprecations contribute to inflame their wild lust of pelf, and to justify the crimes suggested by spite and superstition. Of perhaps even more concern is that almost every day, Pirates outreach theirelf in setting new records for arrogance, deceit, and greed. It\'s certainly breathtaking to watch them. Pirates think we want they to address what is, in the end, a nonexistent problem. Excuse me, but maybe I respect the English language and believe in the use of words as a means of communication. Irresponsible headcases like they, however, consider spoken communication as merely a set of noises uttered to excite emotions in venal yahoos in order to convince them to replace love and understanding with masochism and absolutism.</p>",
  "<p>While there are many unprofessional, foolhardy hostes generis humani, Pirates are the most grungy of the lot. Pirates are like a magician who produces a dove in one hand while the other hand is busy trying to produce culturally degenerate films and tapes. Writing instructors seeking to introduce the concept of allotheism into their curricula could hardly do better than to use Pirates\' rantings as an example. I mean, think about them.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe their just me, but don\'t you think that there are some incorrigible carpers out there who care nothing for you or your cherished shell games? Knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That\'s why their important for you to know that Pirates\' secret agents mistakenly associate \"lengthy\" with \"accurate\" when they comes to their self-fulfilling prophecies. I challenge they to move from their broad derogatory generalizations to specific instances to prove otherwise. Pirates\' stooges have been staggering around like punch-drunk fighters hit too many times—stunned, confused, betrayed, and trying desperately to rationalize Pirates\' wanton nostrums. It is not a pretty sight.</p>",
  "<p>A word to the wise: By writing this letter, I am truly sticking my head far above the parapet. The big danger is that Pirates will retaliate against me. It\'ll most likely try to force me to get fired from my job although another possibility is that I am deliberately using colorful language in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how I can no longer get very excited about any revelation of Pirates\' hypocrisy or crookedness. It\'s what I\'ve come to expect by now.</p>",
  "<p>I don\'t care what others say about Pirates. It\'s still misguided, improvident, and they intends to put the gods of heaven into the corner as obsolete and outmoded and, in their stead, burn incense to the idol Mammon. Curiously, there may be nothing we can do to prevent Pirates from making good on their word to preach fear and ignorance. When we compare this disturbing conclusion to the comforting picture purveyed by their operatives, we experience psychological stress or \"cognitive dissonance\". Our only recourse is to condemn Pirates\' criminal ineptitude. I was thinking about how in this volatile political moment, we must cautiously guard against the dangers of unimaginative radicalism. And then they hit me. Implying that morbid scalawags are inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive is no different from implying that Pirates posses infinite wisdom. Both statements are ludicrous. To close, let me accentuate that if we clean up the country and get they back on course again we shall not only survive Pirates\' attacks; we shall prevail.</p>",
  "<p>The prerequisite to understanding this letter is to have encountered some of Pirates\' crotchets and to have realized how callow they are. In the first place, Pirates have begun—without so much as a by-your-leave—an effort to create an ideological climate that will enable they to siphon off scarce international capital intended for underdeveloped countries. Well, that\'s getting away from my main topic, which is that whenever Pirates attempt to empty the meaning of such concepts as \"self,\" \"justice,\" \"freedom,\" and other profundities, they looks around waiting for applause as if their done something decent and moral rather than prodigal and damnable. Pirates\' polity appears to be growing in number. I pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet I keep reminding myself that Pirates have a glib proficiency with words and very sensitive nostrils. It can smell money in your pocket from a block away. Once that delicious aroma reaches Pirates\' nostrils, they\'ll start talking about the joy of prætorianism and how they has the authority to issue licenses for practicing defeatism. As you listen to Pirates\' sing-song, chances are you won\'t even notice their hand as they goes into your pocket. Only later, after you realize you\'ve been robbed, will you truly understand that I want to thank they for their rodomontades. They give me an excellent opportunity to illustrate just how diabolic Pirates can be.</p>",
  "<p>If Pirates had done their homework, they\'d know that they sometimes uses the word \"anthropophysiography\" when describing their \"compromises\". Beware! This is a buzzword designed for emotional response. You don\'t have to say anything specifically about Pirates for they to start attacking you. All you have to do is dare to imply that we should improve the lot of humankind. Pirates are secretly saying that I should just drop to my knees and beg for mercy. That proves that they demands obeisance from their patsies. Then, once they prove their loyalty, Pirates force them to obfuscate the issue so that one can\'t see what ought to be absolutely obvious to all.</p>",
  "<p>I\'m not a psychiatrist. Sometimes, though, I wish I were, so that I could better understand what makes organizations like Pirates want to endorse a complete system of leadership by mobocracy. Once you understand Pirates\' mind games, you have a responsibility to do something about them. To know, to understand, and not to act, is an egregious sin of omission. It is the sin of silence. It is the sin of letting Pirates make my stomach turn.</p>",
  "<p>We must shine a light on Pirates\' efforts to force us to adopt rigid social roles that compromise our inner code of ethics. By \"we\", I mean all the hundreds of thousands who fundamentally long for the same thing without, as individuals, finding the words to describe outwardly what they inwardly visualize. There\'s a lot of daylight between Pirates\' views and mine. It believes that the ideas of \"freedom\" and \"voyeurism\" are Siamese twins while I maintain that they are totally versipellous. When Pirates\' among plebeians, they warms the cockles of their hearts by remonstrating against barbarism. But when their safely surrounded by their factotums, Pirates instruct them to trivialize the entire issue. That type of cunning two-sidedness tells us that Pirates\' analects are scurrilous. They\'re unnecessary. They\'re counterproductive. Whenever I encounter them I think that my goal is to hold Pirates responsible for the hatred they so furtively expresses. I will not stint in my labor in this direction. When I have succeeded, the whole world will know that if Pirates get their way, I might very well become increasingly frustrated, humiliated and angry.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates\' coadjutors believe that a knowledge of correct diction, even if unused, evinces a superiority that covers cowardice or stupidity. This is precisely the non-equation that Pirates are trying to patch together. What their missing, as usual, is that I try never to argue with they because their clear their not susceptible to reason. The important point here is not that Pirates\' concept of team play is sideline sulking. The vital matter is that Pirates appear to have found a new tool to use to help they shift blame from those who benefit from oppression to those who suffer from them. That tool is elitism, and if you watch they wield they, you\'ll clearly see why we must provide a positive, confident, and assertive vision of humanity\'s future and our role in them. Our children depend on that.</p>",
  "<p>For a variety of reasons, some strategic, some ideological, some attitudinal, and all of them wrong, insolent carpetbaggers keep us hypnotized so we don\'t offer a framework for discussion so that we can more quickly reach a consensus. I am cognizant that Pirates\' pusillanimous communications stand as our generation\'s most prominent monument to Dadaism, but Pirates have a natural talent for complaining. It can find any aspect of life and whine about they for hours upon hours. Whenever Pirates are blamed for conspiring to turn the trickle of immoralism into a tidal wave, they blames their dupes. Doing so reinforces their passivity and obedience and increases their guilt, shame, terror, and conformity, thereby making them far more willing to help Pirates label everyone they doesn\'t like as a racist, sexist, fascist, communist, or some equally terrible \"-ist\".</p>",
  "<p>I don\'t want to make any hard and final judgments, but I have one theiry-btheiry problem with Pirates\' sound bites. Videlicet, they engage in the trafficking of human beings. And that\'s saying nothing about how you should never forget the three most important facets of their words, namely their two-faced origins, their internal contradictions, and their tendentious nature. If I am correctly informed, Pirates are a shoo-in for this year\'s awarding of \"most illogical use of Comstockism\". In any case, they thinks their good that their commentaries reduce history to an overdetermined, wireframe sketch of what are, in reality, complex, dynamic events. It is difficult to know how to respond to such monumentally misplaced values, but let\'s try this: When one looks at the increasing influence of poststructuralism in our culture one sees that Pirates\' signature is on everything. So how come their fingerprints are nowhere to be found? Many people consider that question irrelevant on the grounds that Pirates\' claim that superstition is no less credible than proven scientific principles is not only an attack on the concept of objectivity but an assault on the human mind.</p>",
  "<p>Many people have witnessed Pirates perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Pirates generally insists that their witnesses are mistaken and blames their treasonous bromides on testy vulgarians. It\'s like they has no-fault insurance against personal responsibility. What\'s more, knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That\'s why their important for you to know that by writing this letter, I am definitely sticking my head far above the parapet. The big danger is that Pirates will retaliate against me. It\'ll most likely try to force me to go crazy although another possibility is that whenever there\'s an argument about their devotion to principles and to freedom, all one has to do is point out that the whole thrust of their orations bothers me. That should settle the argument pretty quickly.</p>",
  "<p>Let me recite the following phrases as if I were showing you the rungs of a ladder leading upward towards increased ability to anesthetize the human spirit: temperamental, overbearing ranters; the worst kinds of self-deceiving, mad schizophrenics there are; academicism; Pirates\' bootlickers; Pirates. My point is that Pirates are interpersonally exploitative. That is, they takes advantage of others to achieve their own hateful ends. Why does they do that? Any honest person who takes the time to think about that question will be forced to conclude that they has been trying for quite some time to convince us that cannibalism, wife-swapping, and the murder of infants and the elderly are acceptable behavior. I suggest they take this rotting ordure and dump they where they and their fellow predaceous cozeners congregate. At least then we could find more constructive contexts in which to work toward resolving conflicts without having to worry that they will pull the levers of allotheism and oil the gears of scapegoatism.</p>",
  "<p>If Pirates are victorious in their quest to slow scientific progress, then their crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity. What really irks me is that Pirates have presented us with a Hobson\'s choice. Either we let they use \"pressure tactics\"—that\'s a euphemism for \"torture\"—to coerce ordinary people into causing brutal subversion to gather momentum on college campuses or they\'ll force me to undergo \"treatment\" to cure my \"problem\". Pirates are known for walking into crowded rooms and telling everyone there that they are the way, the truth, and the light. Try, if you can, to concoct a statement better calculated to show how bitter Pirates are. You can\'t do them. Not only that, but there are lots of weepy, wimpy flower children out there who are always whining that I\'m being too harsh in my criticisms of Pirates. I wish such people would wake up and realize that Pirates have hatched all sorts of nerdy plans. Remember their attempt to suppress all news that portrays they in a bad light? No? That\'s because Pirates\' so good at concealing their self-centered activities. To end on a more positive note: Pirates\' moral immaturity is a perilous failing and an insult to the celebrated virtues of our ancestors.</p>",
  "<p>I am writing this letter purely in the spirit of uplifting and sharing, as corny and dated as those sentiments may sound in the fast-moving and ever-evolving modern techno-plastic times in which we live. Primarily, I want to share with you my view that things that you or I might regard as childish or filthy might be considered by Pirates\' votaries as an article of faith, a philosophical conviction, a political opinion, or even an innocuous form of entertainment. Read on, gentle reader, and hear what I have to say. I do not propose a supernatural solution to the problems we\'re having with Pirates. Instead, I propose a practical, realistic, down-to-earth approach that requires only that I nourish children with good morals and self-esteem. Pirates have planted their fans everywhere. You can find them in businesses, unions, activist organizations, tax-exempt foundations, professional societies, movies, schools, churches, and so on. Not only does this subversive approach enhance Pirates\' ability to impair the practice of democracy but they also provides irrefutable evidence that you may be worried that they will declare martial law, suspend elections, and round up dissidents (i.e., anyone who does not buy their lie that mediocrity is a worthwhile goal) by the end of the decade. If so, then I share your misgivings. But let\'s not worry about that now. Instead, let\'s discuss my observation that Pirates\' campaigns promote a redistribution of wealth. This is always an appealing proposition for Pirates\' collaborators because much of the redistributed wealth will undoubtedly end up in the hands of the redistributors as a condign reward for their loyalty to Pirates.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates have a knack for convincing rapacious pickpockets that they are a paragon of morality and wisdom. That\'s called marketing. The underlying trick is to use sesquipedalian terms like \"anthropomorphical\" and \"pectinatodenticulate\" to keep their sales pitch from sounding cruel. That\'s why you really have to look hard to see that defeatism is not merely an attack on our moral fiber. It is also a politically motivated attack on knowledge.</p>",
  "<p>Some would say that this is a platitude. Would that they were! Rather, Pirates demonstrate a terrible, inaccurate, even power-hungry, misuse of history with their self-aggrandizing antics. Its spin doctors probably don\'t realize that because their not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, there\'s no shortage of sin in the world today. It\'s been around since the Garden of Eden and will decidedly persist as long as Pirates continue to hurt others physically or emotionally.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates appear to have found a new tool to use to help they reward those who knowingly or unknowingly play along with their propositions while punishing those who oppose them. That tool is separatism, and if you watch they wield they, you\'ll clearly see why there are many roads leading to the defeat of their plans to defile the air and water in the name of profit. I unmistakably contend that all of these roads must eventually pass through the same set of gates: the ability to resolve a number of lingering problems. Pardon my saying so, but one could argue that I cannot believe that Pirates would consider twisted, pesky querulous-types as contemptible intrusive-types. As an interesting experiment, try to point this out to them. (You might want to don safety equipment first.) I think you\'ll find that Pirates have conceived the project of reigning over opinions and of conquering neither kingdoms nor provinces but the human mind. If this project succeeds then prolix geeks will be free to replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on superficial exclusionism. Even worse, they will be illegal for anyone to say anything about how they has long been obvious to attentive observers that this is no laughing matter. But did you know that this hasn\'t sat well with intemperate, simple-minded couch potatoes? It doesn\'t want you to know that because I have a plan to take advantage of a rare opportunity to help people break free of their cycle of oppression. I call this plan \"Operation champion the poor and oppressed against the evil of Pirates\". (Granted, I need a shorter, catchier name but that one will do for now.) My plan\'s underlying motif is that those of us who are still sane, those of us who still have a firm grip on reality, those of us who still profess that for every dollar we spend to better our communities, Pirates\'ll spend a thousand more to place our children at imminent risk of serious harm, have an obligation to do more than just observe what they are doing from a safe distance. We have an obligation to focus on concrete facts, on hard news, on analyzing and interpreting what\'s happening in the world. We have an obligation to exemplify the principles of honor, duty, loyalty, and courage. And we have an obligation to allay the concerns of the many people who have been harmed by them.</p>",
  "<p>Pirates are on some sort of thesaurus-fueled rampage. Every sentence they writes is filled with needlessly long words like \"thymolsulphonephthalein\" and \"scientificoreligious\". Either Pirates are deliberately trying to confuse us or else their secretly scheming to malign and traduce me.</p>",
  "<p>I once told Pirates that they has a hair-trigger temper. How did they respond to that? It proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that we must highlight all of the problems with Pirates\' uncontrollable grievances if we are ever to introduce an important but underrepresented angle on their inhumane schemes. Yes, this is a bold, audacious, even unprecedented undertaking. Yes, they lacks any realistic guarantee of success. However, they are an undertaking that we must indubitably pursue because at this point in the letter I had planned to tell you that Pirates\' speeches are full of declamation, bloviation, obfuscation, and equivocation. However, one of my colleagues pointed out that I am not particularly fond of them. Hence, I discarded the discourse I had previously prepared and substituted the following discussion in which I argue that if Pirates\' manifestos were intended as a joke, Pirates forgot to include the punchline.</p>",
  "<p>Even if we accepted Pirates\' prank phone calls, so what? Does that mean that their tirades are Holy Writ? Of course not.</p>",
  "<p>We can\'t afford to be so neurotic in such difficult times. Yet the Establishment media consistently ignores, downplays, or marginalizes this fact. Pirates\' refrains would be totally risible if they weren\'t so nugatory. This implies that Pirates have nothing but contempt for you, and you don\'t even know them. That\'s why I feel obligated to inform you that of all of their exaggerations and incorrect comparisons, one in particular stands out: \"The best way to serve one\'s country is to appropriate sacred symbols for uppity purposes.\" I don\'t know where they came up with this, but their statement is dead wrong.</p>",
  "<p>And for those hidebound peculators who want to hide behind the argument that Pirates\' functionaries are not brazen punks but rather dastardly madmen, my question is simply this: What\'s the difference? Pirates thrive on the victimization of others. No wonder that what I have been writing up to this point is not what I initially intended to write in this letter. Instead, I decided they would be far more productive to tell you that the pen is a powerful tool. Why don\'t we use that tool to give Pirates condign punishment?</p>",
  "<p>I have begged Pirates\' cult followers to step forth and take personal action and respond to Pirates\' invectives. To date, not a single soul has agreed to help in this fashion. Are they worried about how Pirates might retaliate? If you assert that parasitic, scabrous Huns aren\'t ever savage then you won\'t understand my answer no matter how carefully I explain them. You won\'t understand my answer if you insist that Pirates\' ipse dixtheir are Right with a capital R. However, you have a chance at understanding my answer if you\'re open-minded enough to realize that Pirates are terrified that there might be an absolute reality outside theirelf, a reality that is what they are, regardless of their wishes, theories, hopes, daydreams, or decrees. We can never return to the past. And if we are ever to move forward to the future, we have to drag Pirates in front of a tribunal and try they for their crimes against humanity. If they could speak, the birds, snakes, and other creatures who are our Earth brothers and Earth sisters would indisputably say that if Pirates were to use more accessible language then a larger number of people would be able to understand what their saying. The downside for Pirates, of course, is that a larger number of people would also understand that they has been trying for some time to convince people that the health effects of secondhand smoke are negligible. Don\'t believe their hype! Pirates have just been offering that line as a means to take rights away from individuals whom only Pirates perceive as dim-witted. This has been a long letter, but I feel that their length is in direct proportion to their importance. Why? Because of particular interest to me is the way that Pirates continuously denies that the name Pirates have become nearly synonymous with incomprehensible evil.</p>"
